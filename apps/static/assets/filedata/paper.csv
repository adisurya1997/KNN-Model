0,Dynamic Backtracking,"Because of their occasional need to return to shallow points in a search tree, existing backtracking methods can sometimes erase meaningful progress toward solving a search problem. In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches.",Artificial Intelligence
1,"A Market-Oriented Programming Environment and its Application to
  Distributed Multicommodity Flow Problems","Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms.",Artificial Intelligence
2,An Empirical Analysis of Search in GSAT,"We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms.",Artificial Intelligence
3,The Difficulties of Learning Logic Programs with Cut,"As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages.",Artificial Intelligence
4,Software Agents: Completing Patterns and Constructing User Interfaces,"To support the goal of allowing users to record and retrieve information, this paper describes an interactive note-taking system for pen-based computers with two distinctive features. First, it actively predicts what the user is going to write. Second, it automatically constructs a custom, button-box user interface on request. The system is an example of a learning-apprentice software- agent. A machine learning component characterizes the syntax and semantics of the user's information. A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and constructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of the note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting archive. Macintosh utilities for binhex are available from mac.archive.umich.edu. QuickTime is available from ftp.apple.com in the dts/mac/sys.soft/quicktime.",Artificial Intelligence
5,Decidable Reasoning in Terminological Knowledge Representation Systems,"Terminological knowledge representation systems (TKRSs) are tools for designing and using knowledge bases that make use of terminological languages (or concept languages). We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted.",Artificial Intelligence
6,Teleo-Reactive Programs for Agent Control,"A formalism is presented for computing and organizing actions for autonomous agents in dynamic environments. We introduce the notion of teleo-reactive (T-R) programs whose execution entails the construction of circuitry for the continuous computation of the parameters and conditions on which agent action is based. In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots.",Artificial Intelligence
7,"Learning the Past Tense of English Verbs: The Symbolic Pattern
  Associator vs. Connectionist Models","Learning the past tense of English verbs - a seemingly minor aspect of language acquisition - has generated heated debates since 1986, and has become a landmark task for testing the adequacy of cognitive modeling. Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for decision-tree learning algorithms.",Artificial Intelligence
8,"Substructure Discovery Using Minimum Description Length and Background
  Knowledge","The ability to identify interesting and repetitive substructures is an essential component to discovering knowledge in structural data. We describe a new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery system, written in C. The program accepts as input databases represented in graph form, and will output discovered substructures with their corresponding value.",Artificial Intelligence
9,Bias-Driven Revision of Logical Domain Theories,"The theory revision problem is the problem of how best to go about revising a deficient domain theory using information contained in examples that expose inaccuracies. In this paper we present our approach to the theory revision problem for propositional domain theories. The approach described here, called PTR, uses probabilities associated with domain theory elements to numerically track the ``flow'' of proof through the theory. This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories.",Artificial Intelligence
10,"Exploring the Decision Forest: An Empirical Investigation of Occam's
  Razor in Decision Tree Induction","We report on a series of experiments in which all decision trees consistent with the training data are constructed. These experiments were run to gain an understanding of the properties of the set of consistent decision trees and the factors that affect the accuracy of individual trees. In particular, we investigated the relationship between the size of a decision tree consistent with some training data and the accuracy of the tree on test data. The experiments were performed on a massively parallel Maspar computer. The results of the experiments on several artificial and two real world problems indicate that, for many of the problems investigated, smaller consistent decision trees are on average less accurate than the average accuracy of slightly larger trees.",Artificial Intelligence
11,"A Semantics and Complete Algorithm for Subsumption in the CLASSIC
  Description Logic","This paper analyzes the correctness of the subsumption algorithm used in CLASSIC, a description logic-based knowledge representation system that is being used in practical applications. In order to deal efficiently with individuals in CLASSIC descriptions, the developers have had to use an algorithm that is incomplete with respect to the standard, model-theoretic semantics for description logics. We provide a variant semantics for descriptions with respect to which the current implementation is complete, and which can be independently motivated. The soundness and completeness of the polynomial-time subsumption algorithm is established using description graphs, which are an abstracted version of the implementation structures used in CLASSIC, and are of independent interest.",Artificial Intelligence
12,Applying GSAT to Non-Clausal Formulas,"In this paper we describe how to modify GSAT so that it can be applied to non-clausal formulas. The idea is to use a particular ``score'' function which gives the number of clauses of the CNF conversion of a formula which are false under a given truth assignment. Its value is computed in linear time, without constructing the CNF conversion itself. The proposed methodology applies to most of the variants of GSAT proposed so far.",Artificial Intelligence
13,Random Worlds and Maximum Entropy,"Given a knowledge base KB containing first-order and statistical facts, we consider a principled method, called the random-worlds method, for computing a degree of belief that some formula Phi holds given KB. If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods.",Artificial Intelligence
14,"Pattern Matching and Discourse Processing in Information Extraction from
  Japanese Text","Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance.",Artificial Intelligence
15,A System for Induction of Oblique Decision Trees,"This article describes a new system for induction of oblique decision trees. This system, OC1, combines deterministic hill-climbing with two forms of randomization to find a good oblique split (in the form of a hyperplane) at each node of a decision tree. Oblique decision tree methods are tuned especially for domains in which the attributes are numeric, although they can be adapted to symbolic or mixed symbolic/numeric attributes. We present extensive empirical studies, using both real and artificial data, that analyze OC1's ability to construct oblique trees that are smaller and more accurate than their axis-parallel counterparts. We also examine the benefits of randomization for the construction of oblique decision trees.",Artificial Intelligence
16,On Planning while Learning,"This paper introduces a framework for Planning while Learning where an agent is given a goal to achieve in an environment whose behavior is only partially known to the agent. We discuss the tractability of various plan-design processes. We show that for a large natural class of Planning while Learning systems, a plan can be presented and verified in a reasonable time. However, coming up algorithmically with a plan, even for simple classes of systems is apparently intractable. We emphasize the role of off-line plan-design processes, and show that, in most natural cases, the verification (projection) part can be carried out in an efficient algorithmic manner.",Artificial Intelligence
17,Wrap-Up: a Trainable Discourse Module for Information Extraction,"The vast amounts of on-line text now available have led to renewed interest in information extraction (IE) systems that analyze unrestricted text, producing a structured representation of selected information from the text. This paper presents a novel approach that uses machine learning to acquire knowledge for some of the higher level IE processing. Wrap-Up is a trainable IE discourse component that makes intersentential inferences and identifies logical relations among information extracted from the text. Previous corpus-based approaches were limited to lower level processing such as part-of-speech tagging, lexical disambiguation, and dictionary construction. Wrap-Up is fully trainable, and not only automatically decides what classifiers are needed, but even derives the feature set for each classifier automatically. Performance equals that of a partially trainable discourse module requiring manual customization for each domain.",Artificial Intelligence
18,Operations for Learning with Graphical Models,"This paper is a multidisciplinary review of empirical, statistical learning from a graphical model perspective. Well-known examples of graphical models include Bayesian networks, directed graphs representing a Markov chain, and undirected networks representing a Markov field. These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms.",Artificial Intelligence
19,Total-Order and Partial-Order Planning: A Comparative Analysis,"For many years, the intuitions underlying partial-order planning were largely taken for granted. Only in the past few years has there been renewed interest in the fundamental principles underlying this paradigm. In this paper, we present a rigorous comparative analysis of partial-order and total-order planning by focusing on two specific planners that can be directly compared. We show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners.",Artificial Intelligence
20,Solving Multiclass Learning Problems via Error-Correcting Output Codes,"Multiclass learning problems involve finding a definition for an unknown function f(x) whose range is a discrete set containing k &gt 2 values (i.e., k ``classes''). The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates. Taken together, these results demonstrate that error-correcting output codes provide a general-purpose method for improving the performance of inductive learning programs on multiclass problems.",Artificial Intelligence
21,A Domain-Independent Algorithm for Plan Adaptation,"The paradigms of transformational planning, case-based planning, and plan debugging all involve a process known as plan adaptation - modifying or repairing an old plan so it solves a new problem. In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph.",Artificial Intelligence
22,"Truncating Temporal Differences: On the Efficient Implementation of
  TD(lambda) for Reinforcement Learning","Temporal difference (TD) methods constitute a class of methods for learning predictions in multi-step prediction problems, parameterized by a recency factor lambda. Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda &gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning.",Artificial Intelligence
23,"Cost-Sensitive Classification: Empirical Evaluation of a Hybrid Genetic
  Decision Tree Induction Algorithm","This paper introduces ICET, a new algorithm for cost-sensitive classification. ICET uses a genetic algorithm to evolve a population of biases for a decision tree induction algorithm. The fitness function of the genetic algorithm is the average cost of classification when using the decision tree, including both the costs of tests (features, measurements) and the costs of classification errors. ICET is compared here with three other algorithms for cost-sensitive classification - EG2, CS-ID3, and IDX - and also with C4.5, which classifies without regard to cost. The five algorithms are evaluated empirically on five real-world medical datasets. Three sets of experiments are performed. The first set examines the baseline performance of the five algorithms on the five datasets and establishes that ICET performs significantly better than its competitors. The second set tests the robustness of ICET under a variety of conditions and shows that ICET maintains its advantage. The third set looks at ICET's search in bias space and discovers a way to improve the search.",Artificial Intelligence
24,"Rerepresenting and Restructuring Domain Theories: A Constructive
  Induction Approach","Theory revision integrates inductive learning and background knowledge by combining training examples with a coarse domain theory to produce a more accurate theory. There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems. This leads to a study of the behavior, limitations, and potential of theory-guided constructive induction.",Artificial Intelligence
25,Using Pivot Consistency to Decompose and Solve Functional CSPs,"Many studies have been carried out in order to increase the search efficiency of constraint satisfaction problems; among them, some make use of structural properties of the constraint network; others take into account semantic properties of the constraints, generally assuming that all the constraints possess the given property. In this paper, we propose a new decomposition method benefiting from both semantic properties of functional constraints (not bijective constraints) and structural properties of the network; furthermore, not all the constraints need to be functional. We show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs.",Artificial Intelligence
26,Adaptive Load Balancing: A Study in Multi-Agent Learning,"We study the process of multi-agent reinforcement learning in the context of load balancing in a distributed system, without use of either central coordination or explicit communication. We first define a precise framework in which to study adaptive load balancing, important features of which are its stochastic nature and the purely local information available to individual agents. Given this framework, we show illuminating results on the interplay between basic adaptive behavior parameters and their effect on system efficiency. We then investigate the properties of adaptive load balancing in heterogeneous populations, and address the issue of exploration vs. exploitation in that context. Finally, we show that naive use of communication may not improve, and might even harm system efficiency.",Artificial Intelligence
27,Provably Bounded-Optimal Agents,"Since its inception, artificial intelligence has relied upon a theoretical foundation centered around perfect rationality as the desired property of intelligent systems. We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory.",Artificial Intelligence
28,Pac-Learning Recursive Logic Programs: Efficient Algorithms,"We present algorithms that learn certain classes of function-free recursive logic programs in polynomial time from equivalence queries. In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate non-recursive clause are also learnable, if an additional ``basecase'' oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem. Thus, taken together with its companion paper, this paper establishes a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive logic programs.",Artificial Intelligence
29,Pac-learning Recursive Logic Programs: Negative Results,"In a companion paper it was shown that the class of constant-depth determinate k-ary recursive clauses is efficiently learnable. In this paper we present negative results showing that any natural generalization of this class is hard to learn in Valiant's model of pac-learnability. In particular, we show that the following program classes are cryptographically hard to learn: programs with an unbounded number of constant-depth linear recursive clauses; programs with one constant-depth determinate clause containing an unbounded number of recursive calls; and programs with one linear recursive clause of constant locality. These results immediately imply the non-learnability of any more general class of programs. We also show that learning a constant-depth determinate program with either two linear recursive clauses or one linear recursive clause and one non-recursive clause is as hard as learning boolean DNF. Together with positive results from the companion paper, these negative results establish a boundary of efficient learnability for recursive function-free clauses.",Artificial Intelligence
30,FLECS: Planning with a Flexible Commitment Strategy,"There has been evidence that least-commitment planners can efficiently handle planning problems that involve difficult goal interactions. This evidence has led to the common belief that delayed-commitment is the ""best"" possible planning strategy. However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning. FLECS provides a framework to investigate the mapping from planning domains and problems to efficient planning strategies.",Artificial Intelligence
31,"Induction of First-Order Decision Lists: Results on Learning the Past
  Tense of English Verbs","This paper presents a method for inducing logic programs from examples that learns a new class of concepts called first-order decision lists, defined as ordered lists of clauses each ending in a cut. The method, called FOIDL, is based on FOIL (Quinlan, 1990) but employs intensional background knowledge and avoids the need for explicit negative examples. It is particularly useful for problems that involve rules with specific exceptions, such as learning the past-tense of English verbs, a task widely studied in the context of the symbolic/connectionist debate. FOIDL is able to learn concise, accurate programs for this problem from significantly fewer examples than previous methods (both connectionist and symbolic).",Artificial Intelligence
32,"Building and Refining Abstract Planning Cases by Change of
  Representation Language","ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning.",Artificial Intelligence
33,Using Qualitative Hypotheses to Identify Inaccurate Data,"Identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a significant and difficult problem in AI. In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra. The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the conventional methods used in many similar systems.",Artificial Intelligence
34,An Integrated Framework for Learning and Reasoning,"Learning and reasoning are both aspects of what is considered to be intelligence. Their studies within AI have been separated historically, learning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning falling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are in many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these interdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines inductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a propositional setting. Several examples that test the framework are presented, including classical induction, many important reasoning protocols and two simple expert systems.",Artificial Intelligence
35,Diffusion of Context and Credit Information in Markovian Models,"This paper studies the problem of ergodicity of transition probability matrices in Markovian models, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs), and how it makes very difficult the task of learning to represent long-term context for sequential data. This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm.",Artificial Intelligence
36,Improving Connectionist Energy Minimization,"Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization, constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset.",Artificial Intelligence
37,"Learning Membership Functions in a Function-Based Object Recognition
  System","Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function. Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership value.",Artificial Intelligence
38,Flexibly Instructable Agents,"This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks.",Artificial Intelligence
39,OPUS: An Efficient Admissible Algorithm for Unordered Search,"OPUS is a branch and bound search algorithm that enables efficient admissible search through spaces for which the order of search operator application is not significant. The algorithm's search efficiency is demonstrated with respect to very large machine learning search spaces. The use of admissible search is of potential value to the machine learning community as it means that the exact learning biases to be employed for complex learning tasks can be precisely specified and manipulated. OPUS also has potential for application in other areas of artificial intelligence, notably, truth maintenance.",Artificial Intelligence
40,"Vision-Based Road Detection in Automotive Systems: A Real-Time
  Expectation-Driven Approach","The main aim of this work is the development of a vision-based road detection system fast enough to cope with the difficult real-time constraints imposed by moving vehicle applications. The hardware platform, a special-purpose massively parallel system, has been chosen to minimize system production and operational costs. This paper presents a novel approach to expectation-driven low-level image segmentation, which can be mapped naturally onto mesh-connected massively parallel SIMD architectures capable of handling hierarchical data structures. The input image is assumed to contain a distorted version of a given template; a multiresolution stretching process is used to reshape the original template in accordance with the acquired image content, minimizing a potential function. The distorted template is the process output.",Artificial Intelligence
41,Generalization of Clauses under Implication,"In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion.",Artificial Intelligence
42,Decision-Theoretic Foundations for Causal Reasoning,"We present a definition of cause and effect in terms of decision-theoretic primitives and thereby provide a principled foundation for causal reasoning. Our definition departs from the traditional view of causation in that causal assertions may vary with the set of decisions available. We argue that this approach provides added clarity to the notion of cause. Also in this paper, we examine the encoding of causal relationships in directed acyclic graphs. We describe a special class of influence diagrams, those in canonical form, and show its relationship to Pearl's representation of cause and effect. Finally, we show how canonical form facilitates counterfactual reasoning.",Artificial Intelligence
43,Translating between Horn Representations and their Characteristic Models,"Characteristic models are an alternative, model based, representation for Horn expressions. It has been shown that these two representations are incomparable and each has its advantages over the other. It is therefore natural to ask what is the cost of translating, back and forth, between these representations. Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it.",Artificial Intelligence
44,Statistical Feature Combination for the Evaluation of Game Positions,"This article describes an application of three well-known statistical methods in the field of game-tree search: using a large number of classified Othello positions, feature weights for evaluation functions with a game-phase-independent meaning are estimated by means of logistic regression, Fisher's linear discriminant, and the quadratic discriminant function for normally distributed features. Thereafter, the playing strengths are compared by means of tournaments between the resulting versions of a world-class Othello program. In this application, logistic regression - which is used here for the first time in the context of game playing - leads to better results than the other approaches.",Artificial Intelligence
45,Rule-based Machine Learning Methods for Functional Prediction,"We describe a machine learning method for predicting the value of a real-valued function, given the values of multiple input variables. The method induces solutions from samples in the form of ordered disjunctive normal form (DNF) decision rules. A central objective of the method and representation is the induction of compact, easily interpretable solutions. This rule-based decision model can be extended to search efficiently for similar cases prior to approximating function values. Experimental results on real-world data demonstrate that the new techniques are competitive with existing machine learning and statistical methods and can sometimes yield superior regression performance.",Artificial Intelligence
46,"The Design and Experimental Analysis of Algorithms for Temporal
  Reasoning","Many applications -- from planning and scheduling to problems in molecular biology -- rely heavily on a temporal reasoning component. In this paper, we discuss the design and empirical analysis of algorithms for a temporal reasoning system based on Allen's influential interval-based framework for representing temporal information. At the core of the system are algorithms for determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems that are of practical size.",Artificial Intelligence
47,"Well-Founded Semantics for Extended Logic Programs with Dynamic
  Preferences",The paper describes an extension of well-founded semantics for logic programs with two types of negation. In this extension information about preferences between rules can be expressed in the logical language and derived dynamically. This is achieved by using a reserved predicate symbol and a naming technique. Conflicts among rules are resolved whenever possible on the basis of derived preference information. The well-founded conclusions of prioritized logic programs can be computed in polynomial time. A legal reasoning example illustrates the usefulness of the approach.,Artificial Intelligence
48,Logarithmic-Time Updates and Queries in Probabilistic Networks,"Traditional databases commonly support efficient query and update procedures that operate in time which is sublinear in the size of the database. Our goal in this paper is to take a first step toward dynamic reasoning in probabilistic databases with comparable efficiency. We propose a dynamic data structure that supports efficient algorithms for updating and querying singly connected Bayesian networks. In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology.",Artificial Intelligence
49,Quantum Computing and Phase Transitions in Combinatorial Search,"We introduce an algorithm for combinatorial search on quantum computers that is capable of significantly concentrating amplitude into solutions for some NP search problems, on average. This is done by exploiting the same aspects of problem structure as used by classical backtrack methods to avoid unproductive search choices. This quantum algorithm is much more likely to find solutions than the simple direct use of quantum parallelism. Furthermore, empirical evaluation on small problems shows this quantum algorithm displays the same phase transition behavior, and at the same location, as seen in many previously studied classical search methods. Specifically, difficult problem instances are concentrated near the abrupt change from underconstrained to overconstrained problems.",Artificial Intelligence
50,Mean Field Theory for Sigmoid Belief Networks,We develop a mean field theory for sigmoid belief networks based on ideas from statistical mechanics. Our mean field theory provides a tractable approximation to the true probability distribution in these networks; it also yields a lower bound on the likelihood of evidence. We demonstrate the utility of this framework on a benchmark problem in statistical pattern recognition---the classification of handwritten digits.,Artificial Intelligence
51,Improved Use of Continuous Attributes in C4.5,"A reported weakness of C4.5 in domains with continuous attributes is addressed by modifying the formation and evaluation of tests on continuous attributes. An MDL-inspired penalty is applied to such tests, eliminating some of them from consideration and altering the relative desirability of all tests. Empirical trials show that the modifications lead to smaller decision trees with higher predictive accuracies. Results also confirm that a new version of C4.5 incorporating these changes is superior to recent approaches that use global discretization and that construct small trees with multi-interval splits.",Artificial Intelligence
52,Active Learning with Statistical Models,"For many types of machine learning algorithms, one can compute the statistically `optimal' way to select training data. In this paper, we review how optimal data selection techniques have been used with feedforward neural networks. We then show how the same principles may be used to select data for two alternative, statistically-based learning architectures: mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression. While the techniques for neural networks are computationally expensive and approximate, the techniques for mixtures of Gaussians and locally weighted regression are both efficient and accurate. Empirically, we observe that the optimality criterion sharply decreases the number of training examples the learner needs in order to achieve good performance.",Artificial Intelligence
53,A Divergence Critic for Inductive Proof,"Inductive theorem provers often diverge. This paper describes a simple critic, a computer program which monitors the construction of inductive proofs attempting to identify diverging proof attempts. Divergence is recognized by means of a ``difference matching'' procedure. The critic then proposes lemmas and generalizations which ``ripple'' these differences away so that the proof can go through without divergence. The critic enables the theorem prover Spike to prove many theorems completely automatically from the definitions alone.",Artificial Intelligence
54,Practical Methods for Proving Termination of General Logic Programs,"Termination of logic programs with negated body atoms (here called general logic programs) is an important topic. One reason is that many computational mechanisms used to process negated atoms, like Clark's negation as failure and Chan's constructive negation, are based on termination conditions. This paper introduces a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs w.r.t. the Prolog selection rule. The idea is to distinguish parts of the program depending on whether or not their termination depends on the selection rule. To this end, the notions of low-, weakly up-, and up-acceptable program are introduced. We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of terminating general logic programs.",Artificial Intelligence
55,Iterative Optimization and Simplification of Hierarchical Clusterings,"Clustering is often used for discovering structure in data. Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions.",Artificial Intelligence
56,Further Experimental Evidence against the Utility of Occam's Razor,"This paper presents new experimental evidence against the utility of Occam's razor. A~systematic procedure is presented for post-processing decision trees produced by C4.5. This procedure was derived by rejecting Occam's razor and instead attending to the assumption that similar objects are likely to belong to the same class. It increases a decision tree's complexity without altering the performance of that tree on the training data from which it is inferred. The resulting more complex decision trees are demonstrated to have, on average, for a variety of common learning tasks, higher predictive accuracy than the less complex original decision trees. This result raises considerable doubt about the utility of Occam's razor as it is commonly applied in modern machine learning.",Artificial Intelligence
57,Least Generalizations and Greatest Specializations of Sets of Clauses,"The main operations in Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) are generalization and specialization, which only make sense in a generality order. In ILP, the three most important generality orders are subsumption, implication and implication relative to background knowledge. The two languages used most often are languages of clauses and languages of only Horn clauses. This gives a total of six different ordered languages. In this paper, we give a systematic treatment of the existence or non-existence of least generalizations and greatest specializations of finite sets of clauses in each of these six ordered sets. We survey results already obtained by others and also contribute some answers of our own. Our main new results are, firstly, the existence of a computable least generalization under implication of every finite set of clauses containing at least one non-tautologous function-free clause (among other, not necessarily function-free clauses). Secondly, we show that such a least generalization need not exist under relative implication, not even if both the set that is to be generalized and the background knowledge are function-free. Thirdly, we give a complete discussion of existence and non-existence of greatest specializations in each of the six ordered languages.",Artificial Intelligence
58,Reinforcement Learning: A Survey,"This paper surveys the field of reinforcement learning from a computer-science perspective. It is written to be accessible to researchers familiar with machine learning. Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.",Artificial Intelligence
59,"Adaptive Problem-solving for Large-scale Scheduling Problems: A Case
  Study","Although most scheduling problems are NP-hard, domain specific techniques perform well in practice but are quite expensive to construct. In adaptive problem-solving solving, domain specific knowledge is acquired automatically for a general problem solver with a flexible control architecture. In this approach, a learning system explores a space of possible heuristic methods for one well-suited to the eccentricities of the given domain and problem distribution. In this article, we discuss an application of the approach to scheduling satellite communications. Using problem distributions based on actual mission requirements, our approach identifies strategies that not only decrease the amount of CPU time required to produce schedules, but also increase the percentage of problems that are solvable within computational resource limitations.",Artificial Intelligence
60,A Formal Framework for Speedup Learning from Problems and Solutions,"Speedup learning seeks to improve the computational efficiency of problem solving with experience. In this paper, we develop a formal framework for learning efficient problem solving from random problems and their solutions. We apply this framework to two different representations of learned knowledge, namely control rules and macro-operators, and prove theorems that identify sufficient conditions for learning in each representation. Our proofs are constructive in that they are accompanied with learning algorithms. Our framework captures both empirical and explanation-based speedup learning in a unified fashion. We illustrate our framework with implementations in two domains: symbolic integration and Eight Puzzle. This work integrates many strands of experimental and theoretical work in machine learning, including empirical learning of control rules, macro-operator learning, Explanation-Based Learning (EBL), and Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) Learning.",Artificial Intelligence
61,2Planning for Contingencies: A Decision-based Approach,"A fundamental assumption made by classical AI planners is that there is no uncertainty in the world: the planner has full knowledge of the conditions under which the plan will be executed and the outcome of every action is fully predictable. These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures.",Artificial Intelligence
62,A Principled Approach Towards Symbolic Geometric Constraint Satisfaction,"An important problem in geometric reasoning is to find the configuration of a collection of geometric bodies so as to satisfy a set of given constraints. Recently, it has been suggested that this problem can be solved efficiently by symbolically reasoning about geometry. This approach, called degrees of freedom analysis, employs a set of specialized routines called plan fragments that specify how to change the configuration of a set of bodies to satisfy a new constraint while preserving existing constraints. A potential drawback, which limits the scalability of this approach, is concerned with the difficulty of writing plan fragments. In this paper we address this limitation by showing how these plan fragments can be automatically synthesized using first principles about geometric bodies, actions, and topology.",Artificial Intelligence
63,On Partially Controlled Multi-Agent Systems,"Motivated by the control theoretic distinction between controllable and uncontrollable events, we distinguish between two types of agents within a multi-agent system: controllable agents, which are directly controlled by the system's designer, and uncontrollable agents, which are not under the designer's direct control. We refer to such systems as partially controlled multi-agent systems, and we investigate how one might influence the behavior of the uncontrolled agents through appropriate design of the controlled agents. In particular, we wish to understand which problems are naturally described in these terms, what methods can be applied to influence the uncontrollable agents, the effectiveness of such methods, and whether similar methods work across different domains. Using a game-theoretic framework, this paper studies the design of partially controlled multi-agent systems in two contexts: in one context, the uncontrollable agents are expected utility maximizers, while in the other they are reinforcement learners. We suggest different techniques for controlling agents' behavior in each domain, assess their success, and examine their relationship.",Artificial Intelligence
64,Spatial Aggregation: Theory and Applications,"Visual thinking plays an important role in scientific reasoning. Based on the research in automating diverse reasoning tasks about dynamical systems, nonlinear controllers, kinematic mechanisms, and fluid motion, we have identified a style of visual thinking, imagistic reasoning. Imagistic reasoning organizes computations around image-like, analogue representations so that perceptual and symbolic operations can be brought to bear to infer structure and behavior. Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines.",Artificial Intelligence
65,A Hierarchy of Tractable Subsets for Computing Stable Models,"Finding the stable models of a knowledge base is a significant computational problem in artificial intelligence. This task is at the computational heart of truth maintenance systems, autoepistemic logic, and default logic. Unfortunately, it is NP-hard. In this paper we present a hierarchy of classes of knowledge bases, Omega_1,Omega_2,..., with the following properties: first, Omega_1 is the class of all stratified knowledge bases; second, if a knowledge base Pi is in Omega_k, then Pi has at most k stable models, and all of them may be found in time O(lnk), where l is the length of the knowledge base and n the number of atoms in Pi; third, for an arbitrary knowledge base Pi, we can find the minimum k such that Pi belongs to Omega_k in time polynomial in the size of Pi; and, last, where K is the class of all knowledge bases, it is the case that union{i=1 to infty} Omega_i = K, that is, every knowledge base belongs to some class in the hierarchy.",Artificial Intelligence
66,"Accelerating Partial-Order Planners: Some Techniques for Effective
  Search Control and Pruning","We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices.",Artificial Intelligence
67,Cue Phrase Classification Using Machine Learning,"Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods.",Artificial Intelligence
68,Mechanisms for Automated Negotiation in State Oriented Domains,"This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation, that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain, which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict', the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes.",Artificial Intelligence

This restriction leads to faster learning times and, in some cases, to definitions that have higher predictive accuracy. Other first-order learning systems might benefit from similar specialization.",Artificial Intelligence
70,MUSE CSP: An Extension to the Constraint Satisfaction Problem,"This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem). This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP.",Artificial Intelligence
71,Exploiting Causal Independence in Bayesian Network Inference,"A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms.",Artificial Intelligence

74,Improved Heterogeneous Distance Functions,"Instance-based learning techniques typically handle continuous and linear input values well, but often do not handle nominal input attributes appropriately. The Value Difference Metric (VDM) was designed to find reasonable distance values between nominal attribute values, but it largely ignores continuous attributes, requiring discretization to map continuous values into nominal values. This paper proposes three new heterogeneous distance functions, called the Heterogeneous Value Difference Metric (HVDM), the Interpolated Value Difference Metric (IVDM), and the Windowed Value Difference Metric (WVDM). These new distance functions are designed to handle applications with nominal attributes, continuous attributes, or both. In experiments on 48 applications the new distance metrics achieve higher classification accuracy on average than three previous distance functions on those datasets that have both nominal and continuous attributes.",Artificial Intelligence
75,"SCREEN: Learning a Flat Syntactic and Semantic Spoken Language Analysis
  Using Artificial Neural Networks","Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework.",Artificial Intelligence
76,A Uniform Framework for Concept Definitions in Description Logics,"Most modern formalisms used in Databases and Artificial Intelligence for describing an application domain are based on the notions of class (or concept) and relationship among classes. One interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus.",Artificial Intelligence
77,Lifeworld Analysis,"We argue that the analysis of agent/environment interactions should be extended to include the conventions and invariants maintained by agents throughout their activity. We refer to this thicker notion of environment as a lifeworld and present a partial set of formal tools for describing structures of lifeworlds and the ways in which they computationally simplify activity. As one specific example, we apply the tools to the analysis of the Toast system and show how versions of the system with very different control structures in fact implement a common control structure together with different conventions for encoding task state in the positions or states of objects in the environment.",Artificial Intelligence
78,"Query DAGs: A Practical Paradigm for Implementing Belief-Network
  Inference","We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching.",Artificial Intelligence
79,"Connectionist Theory Refinement: Genetically Searching the Space of
  Network Topologies","An algorithm that learns from a set of examples should ideally be able to exploit the available resources of (a) abundant computing power and (b) domain-specific knowledge to improve its ability to generalize. Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks.",Artificial Intelligence
80,Flaw Selection Strategies for Partial-Order Planning,"Several recent studies have compared the relative efficiency of alternative flaw selection strategies for partial-order causal link (POCL) planning. We review this literature, and present new experimental results that generalize the earlier work and explain some of the discrepancies in it. In particular, we describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness.",Artificial Intelligence
81,A Complete Classification of Tractability in RCC-5,"We investigate the computational properties of the spatial algebra RCC-5 which is a restricted version of the RCC framework for spatial reasoning. The satisfiability problem for RCC-5 is known to be NP-complete but not much is known about its approximately four billion subclasses. We provide a complete classification of satisfiability for all these subclasses into polynomial and NP-complete respectively. In the process, we identify all maximal tractable subalgebras which are four in total.",Artificial Intelligence
82,"A New Look at the Easy-Hard-Easy Pattern of Combinatorial Search
  Difficulty","The easy-hard-easy pattern in the difficulty of combinatorial search problems as constraints are added has been explained as due to a competition between the decrease in number of solutions and increased pruning. We test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems, rather than changing numbers of solutions.",Artificial Intelligence
83,Eight Maximal Tractable Subclasses of Allen's Algebra with Metric Time,"This paper combines two important directions of research in temporal resoning: that of finding maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra, and that of reasoning with metric temporal information. Eight new maximal tractable subclasses of Allen's interval algebra are presented, some of them subsuming previously reported tractable algebras. The algebras allow for metric temporal constraints on interval starting or ending points, using the recent framework of Horn DLRs. Two of the algebras can express the notion of sequentiality between intervals, being the first such algebras admitting both qualitative and metric time.",Artificial Intelligence
84,"Defining Relative Likelihood in Partially-Ordered Preferential
  Structures","Starting with a likelihood or preference order on worlds, we extend it to a likelihood ordering on sets of worlds in a natural way, and examine the resulting logic. Lewis earlier considered such a notion of relative likelihood in the context of studying counterfactuals, but he assumed a total preference order on worlds. Complications arise when examining partial orders that are not present for total orders. There are subtleties involving the exact approach to lifting the order on worlds to an order on sets of worlds. In addition, the axiomatization of the logic of relative likelihood in the case of partial orders gives insight into the connection between relative likelihood and default reasoning.",Artificial Intelligence
85,Towards Flexible Teamwork,"Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical results.",Artificial Intelligence
86,Identifying Hierarchical Structure in Sequences: A linear-time algorithm,"SEQUITUR is an algorithm that infers a hierarchical structure from a sequence of discrete symbols by replacing repeated phrases with a grammatical rule that generates the phrase, and continuing this process recursively. The result is a hierarchical representation of the original sequence, which offers insights into its lexical structure. The algorithm is driven by two constraints that reduce the size of the grammar, and produce structure as a by-product. SEQUITUR breaks new ground by operating incrementally. Moreover, the method's simple structure permits a proof that it operates in space and time that is linear in the size of the input. Our implementation can process 50,000 symbols per second and has been applied to an extensive range of real world sequences.",Artificial Intelligence
87,"Storing and Indexing Plan Derivations through Explanation-based Analysis
  of Retrieval Failures","Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure.",Artificial Intelligence
88,"A Model Approximation Scheme for Planning in Partially Observable
  Stochastic Domains","Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are a natural model for planning problems where effects of actions are nondeterministic and the state of the world is not completely observable. It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all previous exact algorithms.",Artificial Intelligence
89,Dynamic Non-Bayesian Decision Making,"The model of a non-Bayesian agent who faces a repeated game with incomplete information against Nature is an appropriate tool for modeling general agent-environment interactions. In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area.",Artificial Intelligence
90,When Gravity Fails: Local Search Topology,"Local search algorithms for combinatorial search problems frequently encounter a sequence of states in which it is impossible to improve the value of the objective function; moves through these regions, called plateau moves, dominate the time spent in local search. We analyze and characterize plateaus for three different classes of randomly generated Boolean Satisfiability problems. We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave similarly to local minima. We revisit several enhancements of local search algorithms and explain their performance in light of our results. Finally we discuss strategies for creating the next generation of local search algorithms.",Artificial Intelligence
91,Bidirectional Heuristic Search Reconsidered,"The assessment of bidirectional heuristic search has been incorrect since it was first published more than a quarter of a century ago. For quite a long time, this search strategy did not achieve the expected results, and there was a major misunderstanding about the reasons behind it. Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered.",Artificial Intelligence
92,Incremental Recompilation of Knowledge,"Approximating a general formula from above and below by Horn formulas (its Horn envelope and Horn core, respectively) was proposed by Selman and Kautz (1991, 1996) as a form of ``knowledge compilation,'' supporting rapid approximate reasoning; on the negative side, this scheme is static in that it supports no updates, and has certain complexity drawbacks pointed out by Kavvadias, Papadimitriou and Sideri (1993). On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates.",Artificial Intelligence
93,Monotonicity and Persistence in Preferential Logics,"An important characteristic of many logics for Artificial Intelligence is their nonmonotonicity. This means that adding a formula to the premises can invalidate some of the consequences. There may, however, exist formulae that can always be safely added to the premises without destroying any of the consequences: we say they respect monotonicity. Also, there may be formulae that, when they are a consequence, can not be invalidated when adding any formula to the premises: we call them conservative. We study these two classes of formulae for preferential logics, and show that they are closely linked to the formulae whose truth-value is preserved along the (preferential) ordering. We will consider some preferential logics for illustration, and prove syntactic characterization results for them. The results in this paper may improve the efficiency of theorem provers for preferential logics.",Artificial Intelligence
94,Synthesizing Customized Planners from Specifications,"Existing plan synthesis approaches in artificial intelligence fall into two categories -- domain independent and domain dependent. The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain independent planners.",Artificial Intelligence
95,"Cached Sufficient Statistics for Efficient Machine Learning with Large
  Datasets","This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets.",Artificial Intelligence
96,Tractability of Theory Patching,"In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms.",Artificial Intelligence
97,Integrative Windowing,"In this paper we re-investigate windowing for rule learning algorithms. We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise.",Artificial Intelligence
98,Model-Based Diagnosis using Structured System Descriptions,"This paper presents a comprehensive approach for model-based diagnosis which includes proposals for characterizing and computing preferred diagnoses, assuming that the system description is augmented with a system structure (a directed graph explicating the interconnections between system components). Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions.",Artificial Intelligence
99,"A Selective Macro-learning Algorithm and its Application to the NxN
  Sliding-Tile Puzzle","One of the most common mechanisms used for speeding up problem solvers is macro-learning. Macros are sequences of basic operators acquired during problem solving. Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators. The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size.",Artificial Intelligence
100,The Computational Complexity of Probabilistic Planning,"We examine the computational complexity of testing and finding small plans in probabilistic planning domains with both flat and propositional representations. The complexity of plan evaluation and existence varies with the plan type sought; we examine totally ordered plans, acyclic plans, and looping plans, and partially ordered plans under three natural definitions of plan value. We show that problems of interest are complete for a variety of complexity classes: PL, P, NP, co-NP, PP, NP^PP, co-NP^PP, and PSPACE. In the process of proving that certain planning problems are complete for NP^PP, we introduce a new basic NP^PP-complete problem, E-MAJSAT, which generalizes the standard Boolean satisfiability problem to computations involving probabilistic quantities; our results suggest that the development of good heuristics for E-MAJSAT could be important for the creation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety of problems.",Artificial Intelligence
101,SYNERGY: A Linear Planner Based on Genetic Programming,"In this paper we describe SYNERGY, which is a highly parallelizable, linear planning system that is based on the genetic programming paradigm. Rather than reasoning about the world it is planning for, SYNERGY uses artificial selection, recombination and fitness measure to generate linear plans that solve conjunctive goals. We ran SYNERGY on several domains (e.g., the briefcase problem and a few variants of the robot navigation problem), and the experimental results show that our planner is capable of handling problem instances that are one to two orders of magnitude larger than the ones solved by UCPOP. In order to facilitate the search reduction and to enhance the expressive power of SYNERGY, we also propose two major extensions to our planning system: a formalism for using hierarchical planning operators, and a framework for planning in dynamic environments.",Artificial Intelligence

103,Towards a computational theory of human daydreaming,"This paper examines the phenomenon of daydreaming: spontaneously recalling or imagining personal or vicarious experiences in the past or future. The following important roles of daydreaming in human cognition are postulated: plan preparation and rehearsal, learning from failures and successes, support for processes of creativity, emotion regulation, and motivation.   A computational theory of daydreaming and its implementation as the program DAYDREAMER are presented. DAYDREAMER consists of 1) a scenario generator based on relaxed planning, 2) a dynamic episodic memory of experiences used by the scenario generator, 3) a collection of personal goals and control goals which guide the scenario generator, 4) an emotion component in which daydreams initiate, and are initiated by, emotional states arising from goal outcomes, and 5) domain knowledge of interpersonal relations and common everyday occurrences.   The role of emotions and control goals in daydreaming is discussed. Four control goals commonly used in guiding daydreaming are presented: rationalization, failure/success reversal, revenge, and preparation. The role of episodic memory in daydreaming is considered, including how daydreamed information is incorporated into memory and later used. An initial version of DAYDREAMER which produces several daydreams (in English) is currently running.",Artificial Intelligence

  combinatorial problems with approximate reasoning","Real world combinatorial optimization problems such as scheduling are typically too complex to solve with exact methods. Additionally, the problems often have to observe vaguely specified constraints of different importance, the available data may be uncertain, and compromises between antagonistic criteria may be necessary. We present a combination of approximate reasoning based constraints and iterative optimization based heuristics that help to model and solve such problems in a framework of C++ software libraries called StarFLIP++.

105,"Modeling Belief in Dynamic Systems, Part II: Revision and Update","The study of belief change has been an active area in philosophy and AI. In recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern, 1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including revision and update.",Artificial Intelligence
106,The Symbol Grounding Problem,"How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? How can the meanings of the meaningless symbol tokens, manipulated solely on the basis of their (arbitrary) shapes, be grounded in anything but other meaningless symbols? The problem is analogous to trying to learn Chinese from a Chinese/Chinese dictionary alone. A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) ""iconic representations,"" which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) ""categorical representations,"" which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations. Higher-order (3) ""symbolic representations,"" grounded in these elementary symbols, consist of symbol strings describing category membership relations (e.g., ""An X is a Y that is Z"").",Artificial Intelligence

To remove such drawbacks of these algorithms the IDA* was developed which is both space and time cost efficient. But again IDA* can give an optimal solution for real valued problems like Flow shop scheduling, Travelling Salesman and 0/1 Knapsack due to their real valued cost estimates. Thus further modifications are done on it and the Iterative Deepening Branch and Bound Search Algorithms is developed which meets the requirements. We have tried using this algorithm for the Flow Shop Scheduling Problem and have found that it is quite effective.",Artificial Intelligence
108,Probabilistic Agent Programs,"Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in their environment or ``state.'' Over the last few years, there have been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd Pick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \emph{probabilistic agent program} and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics, though more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide sound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \emph{positive} agent programs.",Artificial Intelligence

110,Uniform semantic treatment of default and autoepistemic logics,"We revisit the issue of connections between two leading formalisms in nonmonotonic reasoning: autoepistemic logic and default logic. For each logic we develop a comprehensive semantic framework based on the notion of a belief pair. The set of all belief pairs together with the so called knowledge ordering forms a complete lattice. For each logic, we introduce several semantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs. Our results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic constructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as modal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic. Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate, the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result explains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two semantics. In the paper, we also discuss approximating skeptical reasoning with autoepistemic and default logics and establish constructive principles behind such approximations.",Artificial Intelligence

However, these algorithms are not complete. That is, they provide no guarantee that a satisfying assignment, if one exists, will be found. Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there are two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time and, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a satisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue that without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for randomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use both notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate the dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as clause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We demonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of variables of the input formula for randomly generated 3-CNF formulas and for the formulas encoding 3- and 4-colorability of graphs.",Artificial Intelligence
112,"Syntactic Autonomy: Why There is no Autonomy without Symbols and How
  Self-Organization Might Evolve Them","Two different types of agency are discussed based on dynamically coherent and incoherent couplings with an environment respectively. I propose that until a private syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent agents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy. When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of description-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled. At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from dynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent computation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed. RNA editing is also mentioned as a process that may have been used to obtain a primordial biological code necessary open-ended evolution.",Artificial Intelligence
113,"Consistency Management of Normal Logic Program by Top-down Abductive
  Proof Procedure","This paper presents a method of computing a revision of a function-free normal logic program. If an added rule is inconsistent with a program, that is, if it leads to a situation such that no stable model exists for a new program, then deletion and addition of rules are performed to avoid inconsistency. We specify a revision by translating a normal logic program into an abductive logic program with abducibles to represent deletion and addition of rules. To compute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down abductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule. We compute a minimally revised program, by choosing a minimal set of abducibles among all the sets of abducibles computed by a top-down proof procedure.",Artificial Intelligence

  Perspective","Diagnostic reasoning has been characterized logically as consistency-based reasoning or abductive reasoning. Previous analyses in the literature have shown, on the one hand, that choosing the (in general more restrictive) abductive definition may be appropriate or not, depending on the content of the knowledge base [Console&Torasso91], and, on the other hand, that, depending on the choice of the definition the same knowledge should be expressed in different form [Poole94].   Since in Model-Based Diagnosis a major problem is finding the right way of abstracting the behavior of the system to be modeled, this paper discusses the relation between modeling, and in particular abstraction in the model, and the notion of diagnosis.",Artificial Intelligence
116,ACLP: Integrating Abduction and Constraint Solving,"ACLP is a system which combines abductive reasoning and constraint solving by integrating the frameworks of Abductive Logic Programming (ALP) and Constraint Logic Programming (CLP). It forms a general high-level knowledge representation environment for abductive problems in Artificial Intelligence and other areas. In ACLP, the task of abduction is supported and enhanced by its non-trivial integration with constraint solving facilitating its application to complex problems. The ACLP system is currently implemented on top of the CLP language of ECLiPSe as a meta-interpreter exploiting its underlying constraint solver for finite domains. It has been applied to the problems of planning and scheduling in order to test its computational effectiveness compared with the direct use of the (lower level) constraint solving framework of CLP on which it is built. These experiments provide evidence that the abductive framework of ACLP does not compromise significantly the computational efficiency of the solutions. Other experiments show the natural ability of ACLP to accommodate easily and in a robust way new or changing requirements of the original problem.",Artificial Intelligence
117,Relevance Sensitive Non-Monotonic Inference on Belief Sequences,"We present a method for relevance sensitive non-monotonic inference from belief sequences which incorporates insights pertaining to prioritized inference and relevance sensitive, inconsistency tolerant belief revision.   Our model uses a finite, logically open sequence of propositional formulas as a representation for beliefs and defines a notion of inference from maxiconsistent subsets of formulas guided by two orderings: a temporal sequencing and an ordering based on relevance relations between the conclusion and formulas in the sequence. The relevance relations are ternary (using context as a parameter) as opposed to standard binary axiomatizations. The inference operation thus defined easily handles iterated revision by maintaining a revision history, blocks the derivation of inconsistent answers from a possibly inconsistent sequence and maintains the distinction between explicit and implicit beliefs. In doing so, it provides a finitely presented formalism and a plausible model of reasoning for automated agents.",Artificial Intelligence
118,Probabilistic Default Reasoning with Conditional Constraints,"We propose a combination of probabilistic reasoning from conditional constraints with approaches to default reasoning from conditional knowledge bases. In detail, we generalize the notions of Pearl's entailment in system Z, Lehmann's lexicographic entailment, and Geffner's conditional entailment to conditional constraints. We give some examples that show that the new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment have similar properties like their classical counterparts. Moreover, we show that the new notions of z-, lexicographic, and conditional entailment are proper generalizations of both their classical counterparts and the classical notion of logical entailment for conditional constraints.",Artificial Intelligence
119,A Compiler for Ordered Logic Programs,"This paper describes a system, called PLP, for compiling ordered logic programs into standard logic programs under the answer set semantics. In an ordered logic program, rules are named by unique terms, and preferences among rules are given by a set of dedicated atoms. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Since the result of the translation is an extended logic program, existing logic programming systems can be used as underlying reasoning engine. In particular, PLP is conceived as a front-end to the logic programming systems dlv and smodels.",Artificial Intelligence

121,Logic Programs with Compiled Preferences,"We describe an approach for compiling preferences into logic programs under the answer set semantics.

An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed theory correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original theory. Our approach allows both the specification of static orderings (as found in most previous work), in which preferences are external to a logic program, as well as orderings on sets of rules. In large part then, we are interested in describing a general methodology for uniformly incorporating preference information in a logic program. Since the result of our translation is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a compiler, available on the web, as a front-end for these programming systems.",Artificial Intelligence

124,Optimal Belief Revision,"We propose a new approach to belief revision that provides a way to change knowledge bases with a minimum of effort. We call this way of revising belief states optimal belief revision. Our revision method gives special attention to the fact that most belief revision processes are directed to a specific informational objective. This approach to belief change is founded on notions such as optimal context and accessibility. For the sentential model of belief states we provide both a formal description of contexts as sub-theories determined by three parameters and a method to construct contexts. Next, we introduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for selecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort involved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we characterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility ordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking of an arbitrary sentence in the language. Finally, we define the adjustment of the accessibility ranking of a revised base of a belief set.",Artificial Intelligence
125,cc-Golog: Towards More Realistic Logic-Based Robot Controllers,"High-level robot controllers in realistic domains typically deal with processes which operate concurrently, change the world continuously, and where the execution of actions is event-driven as in ``charge the batteries as soon as the voltage level is low''. While non-logic-based robot control languages are well suited to express such scenarios, they fare poorly when it comes to projecting, in a conspicuous way, how the world evolves when actions are executed. On the other hand, a logic-based control language like \congolog, based on the situation calculus, is well-suited for the latter. However, it has problems expressing event-driven behavior. In this paper, we show how these problems can be overcome by first extending the situation calculus to support continuous change and event-driven behavior and then presenting \ccgolog, a variant of \congolog which is based on the extended situation calculus. One benefit of \ccgolog is that it narrows the gap in expressiveness compared to non-logic-based control languages while preserving a semantically well-founded projection mechanism.",Artificial Intelligence

It handles a subclass of programs which contain no function symbols and are domain-restricted but supports extensions including built-in functions as well as cardinality and weight constraints. On top of this core engine more involved systems can be built. As an example, we have implemented total and partial stable model computation for disjunctive logic programs. An interesting application method is based on answer set programming, i.e., encoding an application problem as a set of rules so that its solutions are captured by the stable models of the rules. Smodels has been applied to a number of areas including planning, model checking, reachability analysis, product configuration, dynamic constraint satisfaction, and feature interaction.",Artificial Intelligence
127,"E-RES: A System for Reasoning about Actions, Events and Observations","E-RES is a system that implements the Language E, a logic for reasoning about narratives of action occurrences and observations. E's semantics is model-theoretic, but this implementation is based on a sound and complete reformulation of E in terms of argumentation, and uses general computational techniques of argumentation frameworks. The system derives sceptical non-monotonic consequences of a given reformulated theory which exactly correspond to consequences entailed by E's model-theory. The computation relies on a complimentary ability of the system to derive credulous non-monotonic consequences together with a set of supporting assumptions which is sufficient for the (credulous) conclusion to hold. E-RES allows theories to contain general action laws, statements about action occurrences, observations and statements of ramifications (or universal laws). It is able to derive consequences both forward and backward in time. This paper gives a short overview of the theoretical basis of E-RES and illustrates its use on a variety of examples. Currently, E-RES is being extended so that the system can be used for planning.",Artificial Intelligence

One such language is the language of epistemic specifications. As is usual with logic programming languages, the problem of answering queries is intractable in the general case. For extended disjunctive logic programs, an idea that has proven useful in simplifying the investigation of answer sets is the use of splitting sets. In this paper we will present an extended definition of splitting sets that will be applicable to epistemic specifications. Furthermore, an extension of the splitting set theorem will be presented. Also, a characterization of stratified epistemic specifications will be given in terms of splitting sets. This characterization leads us to an algorithmic method of computing world views of a subclass of epistemic logic programs.",Artificial Intelligence
130,DES: a Challenge Problem for Nonmonotonic Reasoning Systems,"The US Data Encryption Standard, DES for short, is put forward as an interesting benchmark problem for nonmonotonic reasoning systems because (i) it provides a set of test cases of industrial relevance which shares features of randomly generated problems and real-world problems, (ii) the representation of DES using normal logic programs with the stable model semantics is simple and easy to understand, and (iii) this subclass of logic programs can be seen as an interesting special case for many other formalizations of nonmonotonic reasoning. In this paper we present two encodings of DES as logic programs: a direct one out of the standard specifications and an optimized one extending the work of Massacci and Marraro. The computational properties of the encodings are studied by using them for DES key search with the Smodels system as the implementation of the stable model semantics. Results indicate that the encodings and Smodels are quite competitive: they outperform state-of-the-art SAT-checkers working with an optimized encoding of DES into SAT and are comparable with a SAT-checker that is customized and tuned for the optimized SAT encoding.",Artificial Intelligence

The study of this relationship is important in connection with the emergence of answer set programming. Whenever the two semantics are equivalent, answer sets can be computed by a satisfiability solver, and the use of answer set solvers such as smodels and dlv is unnecessary. A logic programming representation of the blocks world due to Ilkka Niemelae is discussed as an example.",Artificial Intelligence

  revision and truth maintenance","We introduced decomposable negation normal form (DNNF) recently as a tractable form of propositional theories, and provided a number of powerful logical operations that can be performed on it in polynomial time. We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories.",Artificial Intelligence

134,Planning with Incomplete Information,"Planning is a natural domain of application for frameworks of reasoning about actions and change. In this paper we study how one such framework, the Language E, can form the basis for planning under (possibly) incomplete information. We define two types of plans: weak and safe plans, and propose a planner, called the E-Planner, which is often able to extend an initial weak plan into a safe plan even though the (explicit) information available is incomplete, e.g. for cases where the initial state is not completely known. The E-Planner is based upon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural proof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this proof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts argumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We provide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in particular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known.",Artificial Intelligence

136,A Consistency-Based Model for Belief Change: Preliminary Report,"We present a general, consistency-based framework for belief change. Informally, in revising K by A, we begin with A and incorporate as much of K as consistently possible. Formally, a knowledge base K and sentence A are expressed, via renaming propositions in K, in separate languages. Using a maximization process, we assume the languages are the same insofar as consistently possible. Lastly, we express the resultant knowledge base in a single language. There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended by K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'' represents the revised state; alternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.   The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express other approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and the incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework differs from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect to iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for implementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results than general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite knowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those propositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A.",Artificial Intelligence

139,DATALOG with constraints - an answer-set programming system,"Answer-set programming (ASP) has emerged recently as a viable programming paradigm well attuned to search problems in AI, constraint satisfaction and combinatorics. Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with an intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints. However, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive closure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large theories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such problems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as stable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently and, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their semantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this paper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an implementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the effectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and SMODELS implementation of stable logic programming. Our results show that DC is competitive with the other two approaches, in case of many search problems, often yielding much more efficient solutions.",Artificial Intelligence

First we propose a simple notion of completeness for sets of such rules and establish a completeness result. Then we show an equivalence in an appropriate sense between Boolean constraint propagation and unit propagation, a form of resolution for propositional logic.   Subsequently we characterize one set of such rules by means of the notion of hyper-arc consistency introduced in (Mohr and Masini 1988). Also, we clarify the status of a similar, though different, set of rules introduced in (Simonis 1989a) and more fully in (Codognet and Diaz 1996).",Artificial Intelligence

As a consequence, their scope is restricted to a subset of the huge application domain of MAS. In this paper we propose a generic infrastructure for programming agents whose name is Brainstorm/J.

147,Multi-Channel Parallel Adaptation Theory for Rule Discovery,"In this paper, we introduce a new machine learning theory based on multi-channel parallel adaptation for rule discovery. This theory is distinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of neural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We show how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a parallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing in that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model converges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model adaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on gradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local optimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is developed to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the CFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we prove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a critical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule learning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be extracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the practical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition and hepatitis prognosis prediction.",Artificial Intelligence
148,A Constraint-Driven System for Contract Assembly,"We present an approach for modelling the structure and coarse content of legal documents with a view to providing automated support for the drafting of contracts and contract database retrieval. The approach is designed to be applicable where contract drafting is based on model-form contracts or on existing examples of a similar type. The main features of the approach are: (1) the representation addresses the structure and the interrelationships between the constituent parts of contracts, but not the text of the document itself; (2) the representation of documents is separated from the mechanisms that manipulate it; and (3) the drafting process is subject to a collection of explicitly stated constraints that govern the structure of the documents. We describe the representation of document instances and of 'generic documents', which are data structures used to drive the creation of new document instances, and we show extracts from a sample session to illustrate the features of a prototype system implemented in MacProlog.",Artificial Intelligence
149,Modelling Contractual Arguments,"One influential approach to assessing the ""goodness"" of arguments is offered by the Pragma-Dialectical school (p-d) (Eemeren & Grootendorst 1992). This can be compared with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson 1988), an approach that originates in discourse analysis. In p-d terms an argument is good if it avoids committing a fallacy, whereas in RST terms an argument is good if it is coherent. RST has been criticised (Snoeck Henkemans 1997) for providing only a partially functional account of argument, and similar criticisms have been raised in the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community-particularly by Moore & Pollack (1992)- with regards to its account of intentionality in text in general. Mann and Thompson themselves note that although RST can be successfully applied to a wide range of texts from diverse domains, it fails to characterise some types of text, most notably legal contracts. There is ongoing research in the Artificial Intelligence and Law community exploring the potential for providing electronic support to contract negotiators, focusing on long-term, complex engineering agreements (see for example Daskalopulu & Sergot 1997). This paper provides a brief introduction to RST and illustrates its shortcomings with respect to contractual text. An alternative approach for modelling argument structure is presented which not only caters for contractual text, but also overcomes the aforementioned limitations of RST.",Artificial Intelligence

152,On Properties of Update Sequences Based on Causal Rejection,"We consider an approach to update nonmonotonic knowledge bases represented as extended logic programs under answer set semantics. New information is incorporated into the current knowledge base subject to a causal rejection principle enforcing that, in case of conflicts, more recent rules are preferred and older rules are overridden. Such a rejection principle is also exploited in other approaches to update logic programs, e.g., in dynamic logic programming by Alferes et al. We give a thorough analysis of properties of our approach, to get a better understanding of the causal rejection principle. We review postulates for update and revision operators from the area of theory change and nonmonotonic reasoning, and some new properties are considered as well. We then consider refinements of our semantics which incorporate a notion of minimality of change. As well, we investigate the relationship to other approaches, showing that our approach is semantically equivalent to inheritance programs by Buccafurri et al. and that it coincides with certain classes of dynamic logic programs, for which we provide characterizations in terms of graph conditions. Therefore, most of our results about properties of causal rejection principle apply to these approaches as well. Finally, we deal with computational complexity of our approach, and outline how the update semantics and its refinements can be implemented on top of existing logic programming engines.",Artificial Intelligence

These agents will usually obey some (minimal) rationality constraints. This leads to the definition of rational competitive analysis. We introduce the concept of rational competitive analysis, and initiate the study of competitive analysis for multi-agent systems. We also discuss the application of rational competitive analysis to the context of bidding games, as well as to the classical one-way trading problem.",Artificial Intelligence

156,"Nonmonotonic Reasoning, Preferential Models and Cumulative Logics","Many systems that exhibit nonmonotonic behavior have been described and studied already in the literature. The general notion of nonmonotonic reasoning, though, has almost always been described only negatively, by the property it does not enjoy, i.e. monotonicity. We study here general patterns of nonmonotonic reasoning and try to isolate properties that could help us map the field of nonmonotonic reasoning by reference to positive properties. We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D. Gabbay, while the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in. Five such families are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams. The ""preferential"" models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic. The extension of our results to first order predicate calculi and the study of the computational complexity of the decision problems described in this paper will be treated in another paper.",Artificial Intelligence
157,What does a conditional knowledge base entail?,"This paper presents a logical approach to nonmonotonic reasoning based on the notion of a nonmonotonic consequence relation. A conditional knowledge base, consisting of a set of conditional assertions of the type ""if ... then ..."", represents the explicit defeasible knowledge an agent has about the way the world generally behaves. We look for a plausible definition of the set of all conditional assertions entailed by a conditional knowledge base. In a previous paper, S. Kraus and the authors defined and studied ""preferential"" consequence relations. They noticed that not all preferential relations could be considered as reasonable inference procedures. This paper studies a more restricted class of consequence relations, ""rational"" relations. It is argued that any reasonable nonmonotonic inference procedure should define a rational relation. It is shown that the rational relations are exactly those that may be represented by a ""ranked"" preferential model, or by a (non-standard) probabilistic model. The rational closure of a conditional knowledge base is defined and shown to provide an attractive answer to the question of the title. Global properties of this closure operation are proved: it is a cumulative operation. It is also computationally tractable. This paper assumes the underlying language is propositional.",Artificial Intelligence

159,Distance Semantics for Belief Revision,"A vast and interesting family of natural semantics for belief revision is defined. Suppose one is given a distance d between any two models. One may then define the revision of a theory K by a formula a as the theory defined by the set of all those models of a that are closest, by d, to the set of models of K. This family is characterized by a set of rationality postulates that extends the AGM postulates. The new postulates describe properties of iterated revisions.",Artificial Intelligence
160,Preferred History Semantics for Iterated Updates,"We give a semantics to iterated update by a preference relation on possible developments. An iterated update is a sequence of formulas, giving (incomplete) information about successive states of the world. A development is a sequence of models, describing a possible trajectory through time. We assume a principle of inertia and prefer those developments, which are compatible with the information, and avoid unnecessary changes. The logical properties of the updates defined in this way are considered, and a representation result is proved.",Artificial Intelligence
161,Nonmonotonic inference operations,"A. Tarski proposed the study of infinitary consequence operations as the central topic of mathematical logic. He considered monotonicity to be a property of all such operations. In this paper, we weaken the monotonicity requirement and consider more general operations, inference operations. These operations describe the nonmonotonic logics both humans and machines seem to be using when infering defeasible information from incomplete knowledge. We single out a number of interesting families of inference operations. This study of infinitary inference operations is inspired by the results of Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor on finitary nonmonotonic operations, but this paper is self-contained.",Artificial Intelligence
162,The logical meaning of Expansion,"The Expansion property considered by researchers in Social Choice is shown to correspond to a logical property of nonmonotonic consequence relations that is the {\em pure}, i.e., not involving connectives, version of a previously known weak rationality condition. The assumption that the union of two definable sets of models is definable is needed for the soundness part of the result.",Artificial Intelligence
163,Another perspective on Default Reasoning,"The lexicographic closure of any given finite set D of normal defaults is defined. A conditional assertion ""if a then b"" is in this lexicographic closure if, given the defaults D and the fact a, one would conclude b. The lexicographic closure is essentially a rational extension of D, and of its rational closure, defined in a previous paper. It provides a logic of normal defaults that is different from the one proposed by R. Reiter and that is rich enough not to require the consideration of non-normal defaults. A large number of examples are provided to show that the lexicographic closure corresponds to the basic intuitions behind Reiter's logic of defaults.",Artificial Intelligence
164,Deductive Nonmonotonic Inference Operations: Antitonic Representations,"We provide a characterization of those nonmonotonic inference operations C for which C(X) may be described as the set of all logical consequences of X together with some set of additional assumptions S(X) that depends anti-monotonically on X (i.e., X is a subset of Y implies that S(Y) is a subset of S(X)). The operations represented are exactly characterized in terms of properties most of which have been studied in Freund-Lehmann(cs.AI/0202031). Similar characterizations of right-absorbing and cumulative operations are also provided. For cumulative operations, our results fit in closely with those of Freund. We then discuss extending finitary operations to infinitary operations in a canonical way and discuss co-compactness properties. Our results provide a satisfactory notion of pseudo-compactness, generalizing to deductive nonmonotonic operations the notion of compactness for monotonic operations. They also provide an alternative, more elegant and more general, proof of the existence of an infinitary deductive extension for any finitary deductive operation (Theorem 7.9 of Freund-Lehmann).",Artificial Intelligence
165,Stereotypical Reasoning: Logical Properties,Stereotypical reasoning assumes that the situation at hand is one of a kind and that it enjoys the properties generally associated with that kind of situation. It is one of the most basic forms of nonmonotonic reasoning. A formal model for stereotypical reasoning is proposed and the logical properties of this form of reasoning are studied. Stereotypical reasoning is shown to be cumulative under weak assumptions.,Artificial Intelligence
166,A Framework for Compiling Preferences in Logic Programs,"We introduce a methodology and framework for expressing general preference information in logic programming under the answer set semantics. An ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form s < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler as a front-end for these programming systems.",Artificial Intelligence
167,Two results for proiritized logic programming,"Prioritized default reasoning has illustrated its rich expressiveness and flexibility in knowledge representation and reasoning. However, many important aspects of prioritized default reasoning have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we investigate two properties of prioritized logic programs in the context of answer set semantics. Specifically, we reveal a close relationship between mutual defeasibility and uniqueness of the answer set for a prioritized logic program. We then explore how the splitting technique for extended logic programs can be extended to prioritized logic programs. We prove splitting theorems that can be used to simplify the evaluation of a prioritized logic program under certain conditions.",Artificial Intelligence
168,Belief Revision and Rational Inference,"The (extended) AGM postulates for belief revision seem to deal with the revision of a given theory K by an arbitrary formula, but not to constrain the revisions of two different theories by the same formula. A new postulate is proposed and compared with other similar postulates that have been proposed in the literature. The AGM revisions that satisfy this new postulate stand in one-to-one correspondence with the rational, consistency-preserving relations. This correspondence is described explicitly. Two viewpoints on iterative revisions are distinguished and discussed.",Artificial Intelligence
169,Ultimate approximations in nonmonotonic knowledge representation systems,"We study fixpoints of operators on lattices. To this end we introduce the notion of an approximation of an operator. We order approximations by means of a precision ordering. We show that each lattice operator O has a unique most precise or ultimate approximation. We demonstrate that fixpoints of this ultimate approximation provide useful insights into fixpoints of the operator O.   We apply our theory to logic programming and introduce the ultimate Kripke-Kleene, well-founded and stable semantics. We show that the ultimate Kripke-Kleene and well-founded semantics are more precise then their standard counterparts We argue that ultimate semantics for logic programming have attractive epistemological properties and that, while in general they are computationally more complex than the standard semantics, for many classes of theories, their complexity is no worse.",Artificial Intelligence
170,Handling Defeasibilities in Action Domains,"Representing defeasibility is an important issue in common sense reasoning. In reasoning about action and change, this issue becomes more difficult because domain and action related defeasible information may conflict with general inertia rules. Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also interfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a prioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning about action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\cal AT}^{0}, {\cal AT}^{1} and {\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in action domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and actions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a higher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower superscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\cal A} language but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where transition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By illustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a powerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and postdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action languages and characterize classes of action domains that present more desirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action languages.",Artificial Intelligence
171,Anticipatory Guidance of Plot,"An anticipatory system for guiding plot development in interactive narratives is described. The executable model is a finite automaton that provides the implemented system with a look-ahead. The identification of undesirable future states in the model is used to guide the player, in a transparent manner. In this way, too radical twists of the plot can be avoided. Since the player participates in the development of the plot, such guidance can have many forms, depending on the environment of the player, on the behavior of the other players, and on the means of player interaction. We present a design method for interactive narratives which produces designs suitable for the implementation of anticipatory mechanisms. Use of the method is illustrated by application to our interactive computer game Kaktus.",Artificial Intelligence
172,"Abduction, ASP and Open Logic Programs","Open logic programs and open entailment have been recently proposed as an abstract framework for the verification of incomplete specifications based upon normal logic programs and the stable model semantics. There are obvious analogies between open predicates and abducible predicates. However, despite superficial similarities, there are features of open programs that have no immediate counterpart in the framework of abduction and viceversa. Similarly, open programs cannot be immediately simulated with answer set programming (ASP). In this paper we start a thorough investigation of the relationships between open inference, abduction and ASP. We shall prove that open programs generalize the other two frameworks. The generalized framework suggests interesting extensions of abduction under the generalized stable model semantics. In some cases, we will be able to reduce open inference to abduction and ASP, thereby estimating its computational complexity. At the same time, the aforementioned reduction opens the way to new applications of abduction and ASP.",Artificial Intelligence
173,Domain-Dependent Knowledge in Answer Set Planning,"In this paper we consider three different kinds of domain-dependent control knowledge (temporal, procedural and HTN-based) that are useful in planning. Our approach is declarative and relies on the language of logic programming with answer set semantics (AnsProlog*). AnsProlog* is designed to plan without control knowledge. We show how temporal, procedural and HTN-based control knowledge can be incorporated into AnsProlog* by the modular addition of a small number of domain-dependent rules, without the need to modify the planner. We formally prove the correctness of our planner, both in the absence and presence of the control knowledge. Finally, we perform some initial experimentation that demonstrates the potential reduction in planning time that can be achieved when procedural domain knowledge is used to solve planning problems with large plan length.",Artificial Intelligence
174,"""Minimal defence"": a refinement of the preferred semantics for
  argumentation frameworks","Dung's abstract framework for argumentation enables a study of the interactions between arguments based solely on an ``attack'' binary relation on the set of arguments. Various ways to solve conflicts between contradictory pieces of information have been proposed in the context of argumentation, nonmonotonic reasoning or logic programming, and can be captured by appropriate semantics within Dung's framework. A common feature of these semantics is that one can always maximize in some sense the set of acceptable arguments. We propose in this paper to extend Dung's framework in order to allow for the representation of what we call ``restricted'' arguments: these arguments should only be used if absolutely necessary, that is, in order to support other arguments that would otherwise be defeated. We modify Dung's preferred semantics accordingly: a set of arguments becomes acceptable only if it contains a minimum of restricted arguments, for a maximum of unrestricted arguments.",Artificial Intelligence

176,Collective Argumentation,"An extension of an abstract argumentation framework, called collective argumentation, is introduced in which the attack relation is defined directly among sets of arguments. The extension turns out to be suitable, in particular, for representing semantics of disjunctive logic programs. Two special kinds of collective argumentation are considered in which the opponents can share their arguments.",Artificial Intelligence
177,Logic Programming with Ordered Disjunction,"Logic programs with ordered disjunction (LPODs) combine ideas underlying Qualitative Choice Logic (Brewka et al. KR 2002) and answer set programming. Logic programming under answer set semantics is extended with a new connective called ordered disjunction. The new connective allows us to represent alternative, ranked options for problem solutions in the heads of rules: A \times B intuitively means: if possible A, but if A is not possible then at least B. The semantics of logic programs with ordered disjunction is based on a preference relation on answer sets. LPODs are useful for applications in design and configuration and can serve as a basis for qualitative decision making.",Artificial Intelligence
178,Compilation of Propositional Weighted Bases,"In this paper, we investigate the extent to which knowledge compilation can be used to improve inference from propositional weighted bases. We present a general notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any equivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive results are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified, showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time polynomial in the output size. Finally, we sketch how our results can be used in model-based diagnosis in order to compute the most probable diagnoses of a system.",Artificial Intelligence
179,Modeling Complex Domains of Actions and Change,"This paper studies the problem of modeling complex domains of actions and change within high-level action description languages. We investigate two main issues of concern: (a) can we represent complex domains that capture together different problems such as ramifications, non-determinism and concurrency of actions, at a high-level, close to the given natural ontology of the problem domain and (b) what features of such a representation can affect, and how, its computational behaviour. The paper describes the main problems faced in this representation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological guidelines for representing complex domains. Although our work has been carried out within one particular high-level description language, we believe that the results, especially those that relate to the problems of representation, are independent of the specific modeling language.",Artificial Intelligence

181,"Preferred well-founded semantics for logic programming by alternating
  fixpoints: Preliminary report","We analyze the problem of defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic programs within a general framework based on alternating fixpoint theory. We start by showing that generalizations of existing answer set approaches to preference are too weak in the setting of well-founded semantics. We then specify some informal yet intuitive criteria and propose a semantical framework for preference handling that is more suitable for defining well-founded semantics for ordered logic programs. The suitability of the new approach is convinced by the fact that many attractive properties are satisfied by our semantics. In particular, our semantics is still correct with respect to various existing answer sets semantics while it successfully overcomes the weakness of their generalization to well-founded semantics. Finally, we indicate how an existing preferred well-founded semantics can be captured within our semantical framework.",Artificial Intelligence
182,Embedding Default Logic in Propositional Argumentation Systems,"In this paper we present a transformation of finite propositional default theories into so-called propositional argumentation systems. This transformation allows to characterize all notions of Reiter's default logic in the framework of argumentation systems. As a consequence, computing extensions, or determining wether a given formula belongs to one extension or all extensions can be answered without leaving the field of classical propositional logic. The transformation proposed is linear in the number of defaults.",Artificial Intelligence

The main result of the paper is an elegant characterization of the existence and multiplicity of extensions in terms of the notion of dialectical justification, a close cousin of the notion of admissibility. The characterization is given in the context of the particular logic for dialectical argumentation DEFLOG. The results are of direct relevance for several well-established models of defeasible reasoning (like default logic, logic programming and argumentation frameworks), since elsewhere dialectical argumentation has been shown to have close formal connections with these models.",Artificial Intelligence
184,"Nonmonotonic Probabilistic Logics between Model-Theoretic Probabilistic
  Logic and Probabilistic Logic under Coherence","Recently, it has been shown that probabilistic entailment under coherence is weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment. Moreover, probabilistic entailment under coherence is a generalization of default entailment in System P. In this paper, we continue this line of research by presenting probabilistic generalizations of more sophisticated notions of classical default entailment that lie between model-theoretic probabilistic entailment and probabilistic entailment under coherence. That is, the new formalisms properly generalize their counterparts in classical default reasoning, they are weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment, and they are stronger than probabilistic entailment under coherence. The new formalisms are useful especially for handling probabilistic inconsistencies related to conditioning on zero events. They can also be applied for probabilistic belief revision. More generally, in the same spirit as a similar previous paper, this paper sheds light on exciting new formalisms for probabilistic reasoning beyond the well-known standard ones.",Artificial Intelligence
185,Evaluating Defaults,"We seek to find normative criteria of adequacy for nonmonotonic logic similar to the criterion of validity for deductive logic. Rather than stipulating that the conclusion of an inference be true in all models in which the premises are true, we require that the conclusion of a nonmonotonic inference be true in ``almost all'' models of a certain sort in which the premises are true. This ``certain sort'' specification picks out the models that are relevant to the inference, taking into account factors such as specificity and vagueness, and previous inferences. The frequencies characterizing the relevant models reflect known frequencies in our actual world. The criteria of adequacy for a default inference can be extended by thresholding to criteria of adequacy for an extension. We show that this avoids the implausibilities that might otherwise result from the chaining of default inferences. The model proportions, when construed in terms of frequencies, provide a verifiable grounding of default rules, and can become the basis for generating default rules from statistics.",Artificial Intelligence
186,Linking Makinson and Kraus-Lehmann-Magidor preferential entailments,"About ten years ago, various notions of preferential entailment have been introduced. The main reference is a paper by Kraus, Lehmann and Magidor (KLM), one of the main competitor being a more general version defined by Makinson (MAK). These two versions have already been compared, but it is time to revisit these comparisons. Here are our three main results: (1) These two notions are equivalent, provided that we restrict our attention, as done in KLM, to the cases where the entailment respects logical equivalence (on the left and on the right). (2) A serious simplification of the description of the fundamental cases in which MAK is equivalent to KLM, including a natural passage in both ways. (3) The two previous results are given for preferential entailments more general than considered in some of the original texts, but they apply also to the original definitions and, for this particular case also, the models can be simplified.",Artificial Intelligence

189,Reasoning about Evolving Nonmonotonic Knowledge Bases,"Recently, several approaches to updating knowledge bases modeled as extended logic programs have been introduced, ranging from basic methods to incorporate (sequences of) sets of rules into a logic program, to more elaborate methods which use an update policy for specifying how updates must be incorporated. In this paper, we introduce a framework for reasoning about evolving knowledge bases, which are represented as extended logic programs and maintained by an update policy. We first describe a formal model which captures various update approaches, and we define a logical language for expressing properties of evolving knowledge bases. We then investigate semantical and computational properties of our framework, where we focus on properties of knowledge states with respect to the canonical reasoning task of whether a given formula holds on a given evolving knowledge base. In particular, we present finitary characterizations of the evolution for certain classes of framework instances, which can be exploited for obtaining decidability results. In more detail, we characterize the complexity of reasoning for some meaningful classes of evolving knowledge bases, ranging from polynomial to double exponential space complexity.",Artificial Intelligence

  Virtual Laboratory, with Implications to the Notion of Cognition","In this thesis I present a virtual laboratory which implements five different models for controlling animats: a rule-based system, a behaviour-based system, a concept-based system, a neural network, and a Braitenberg architecture. Through different experiments, I compare the performance of the models and conclude that there is no ""best"" model, since different models are better for different things in different contexts.   The models I chose, although quite simple, represent different approaches for studying cognition. Using the results as an empirical philosophical aid,   I note that there is no ""best"" approach for studying cognition, since different approaches have all advantages and disadvantages, because they study different aspects of cognition from different contexts. This has implications for current debates on ""proper"" approaches for cognition: all approaches are a bit proper, but none will be ""proper enough"".

The equivalence between the two representations is shown for the two revision operations.",Artificial Intelligence
192,"Can the whole brain be simpler than its ""parts""?","This is the first in a series of connected papers discussing the problem of a dynamically reconfigurable universal learning neurocomputer that could serve as a computational model for the whole human brain. The whole series is entitled ""The Brain Zero Project. My Brain as a Dynamically Reconfigurable Universal Learning Neurocomputer."" (For more information visit the website www.brain0.com.) This introductory paper is concerned with general methodology. Its main goal is to explain why it is critically important for both neural modeling and cognitive modeling to pay much attention to the basic requirements of the whole brain as a complex computing system. The author argues that it can be easier to develop an adequate computational model for the whole ""unprogrammed"" (untrained) human brain than to find adequate formal representations of some nontrivial parts of brain's performance. (In the same way as, for example, it is easier to describe the behavior of a complex analytical function than the behavior of its real and/or imaginary part.) The ""curse of dimensionality"" that plagues purely phenomenological (""brainless"") cognitive theories is a natural penalty for an attempt to represent insufficiently large parts of brain's performance in a state space of insufficiently high dimensionality.

197,Searching for Plannable Domains can Speed up Reinforcement Learning,"Reinforcement learning (RL) involves sequential decision making in uncertain environments. The aim of the decision-making agent is to maximize the benefit of acting in its environment over an extended period of time. Finding an optimal policy in RL may be very slow. To speed up learning, one often used solution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton's Dyna algorithm, or various other methods using macro-actions.   Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of the world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement learning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple model, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model makes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an optimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal. In turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables fast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations.",Artificial Intelligence
198,Temporal plannability by variance of the episode length,"Optimization of decision problems in stochastic environments is usually concerned with maximizing the probability of achieving the goal and minimizing the expected episode length. For interacting agents in time-critical applications, learning of the possibility of scheduling of subtasks (events) or the full task is an additional relevant issue. Besides, there exist highly stochastic problems where the actual trajectories show great variety from episode to episode, but completing the task takes almost the same amount of time. The identification of sub-problems of this nature may promote e.g., planning, scheduling and segmenting Markov decision processes. In this work, formulae for the average duration as well as the standard deviation of the duration of events are derived. The emerging Bellman-type equation is a simple extension of Sobel's work (1982). Methods of dynamic programming as well as methods of reinforcement learning can be applied for our extension. Computer demonstration on a toy problem serve to highlight the principle.",Artificial Intelligence

  Logic Programs","Much work has been done on extending the well-founded semantics to general disjunctive logic programs and various approaches have been proposed. However, these semantics are different from each other and no consensus is reached about which semantics is the most intended. In this paper we look at disjunctive well-founded reasoning from different angles. We show that there is an intuitive form of the well-founded reasoning in disjunctive logic programming which can be characterized by slightly modifying some exisitng approaches to defining disjunctive well-founded semantics, including program transformations, argumentation, unfounded sets (and resolution-like procedure). We also provide a bottom-up procedure for this semantics. The significance of our work is not only in clarifying the relationship among different approaches, but also shed some light on what is an intended well-founded semantics for disjunctive logic programs.",Artificial Intelligence

Although our approach is extensible to other semantics by means of an alternating fixpoint theory, we focus here on the elaboration of preferences under answer set semantics. Alternatively, we show how these approaches can be characterized by the concept of order preservation. These uniform semantic characterizations provide us with new insights about interrelationships and moreover about ways of implementation.",Artificial Intelligence
201,Defeasible Logic Programming: An Argumentative Approach,"The work reported here introduces Defeasible Logic Programming (DeLP), a formalism that combines results of Logic Programming and Defeasible Argumentation. DeLP provides the possibility of representing information in the form of weak rules in a declarative manner, and a defeasible argumentation inference mechanism for warranting the entailed conclusions.   In DeLP an argumentation formalism will be used for deciding between contradictory goals. Queries will be supported by arguments that could be defeated by other arguments. A query q will succeed when there is an argument A for q that is warranted, ie, the argument A that supports q is found undefeated by a warrant procedure that implements a dialectical analysis.   The defeasible argumentation basis of DeLP allows to build applications that deal with incomplete and contradictory information in dynamic domains. Thus, the resulting approach is suitable for representing agent's knowledge and for providing an argumentation based reasoning mechanism to agents.",Artificial Intelligence

In this paper we present a constraint-based analysis of composite solvers that integrates reasoning about the individual solvers and the processed data. The idea is to approximate this reasoning by resolution of set constraints on the finite sets representing the predicates that express all the necessary properties.

In turn, it is of considerable importance to represent Kalman-filter in connectionist forms with local Hebbian learning rules. To our best knowledge, Kalman-filter has not been given such local representation. It seems that the main obstacle is the dynamic adaptation of the Kalman-gain. Here, a connectionist representation is presented, which is derived by means of the recursive prediction error method. We show that this method gives rise to attractive local learning rules and can adapt the Kalman-gain.",Artificial Intelligence
204,On the Notion of Cognition,"We discuss philosophical issues concerning the notion of cognition basing ourselves in experimental results in cognitive sciences, especially in computer simulations of cognitive systems. There have been debates on the ""proper"" approach for studying cognition, but we have realized that all approaches can be in theory equivalent. Different approaches model different properties of cognitive systems from different perspectives, so we can only learn from all of them. We also integrate ideas from several perspectives for enhancing the notion of cognition, such that it can contain other definitions of cognition as special cases. This allows us to propose a simple classification of different types of cognition.",Artificial Intelligence
205,Unfolding Partiality and Disjunctions in Stable Model Semantics,"The paper studies an implementation methodology for partial and disjunctive stable models where partiality and disjunctions are unfolded from a logic program so that an implementation of stable models for normal (disjunction-free) programs can be used as the core inference engine. The unfolding is done in two separate steps. Firstly, it is shown that partial stable models can be captured by total stable models using a simple linear and modular program transformation. Hence, reasoning tasks concerning partial stable models can be solved using an implementation of total stable models. Disjunctive partial stable models have been lacking implementations which now become available as the translation handles also the disjunctive case. Secondly, it is shown how total stable models of disjunctive programs can be determined by computing stable models for normal programs. Hence, an implementation of stable models of normal programs can be used as a core engine for implementing disjunctive programs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by constructing a system for computing stable models of disjunctive programs using the smodels system as the core engine. The performance of the resulting system is compared to that of dlv which is a state-of-the-art special purpose system for disjunctive programs.",Artificial Intelligence
206,Multi-target particle filtering for the probability hypothesis density,"When tracking a large number of targets, it is often computationally expensive to represent the full joint distribution over target states. In cases where the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a separate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem. Another approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track only the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis density (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the expected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is kept, the model-data association problem is avoided.   The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD filter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of multiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show that the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving near-real-time performance.",Artificial Intelligence
207,A Framework for Searching AND/OR Graphs with Cycles,"Search in cyclic AND/OR graphs was traditionally known to be an unsolved problem. In the recent past several important studies have been reported in this domain. In this paper, we have taken a fresh look at the problem. First, a new and comprehensive theoretical framework for cyclic AND/OR graphs has been presented, which was found missing in the recent literature. Based on this framework, two best-first search algorithms, S1 and S2, have been developed. S1 does uninformed search and is a simple modification of the Bottom-up algorithm by Martelli and Montanari. S2 performs a heuristically guided search and replicates the modification in Bottom-up's successors, namely HS and AO*. Both S1 and S2 solve the problem of searching AND/OR graphs in presence of cycles. We then present a detailed analysis for the correctness and complexity results of S1 and S2, using the proposed framework. We have observed through experiments that S1 and S2 output correct results in all cases.",Artificial Intelligence
208,On rho in a Decision-Theoretic Apparatus of Dempster-Shafer Theory,"Thomas M. Strat has developed a decision-theoretic apparatus for Dempster-Shafer theory (Decision analysis using belief functions, Intern. J. Approx. Reason. 4(5/6), 391-417, 1990). In this apparatus, expected utility intervals are constructed for different choices. The choice with the highest expected utility is preferable to others. However, to find the preferred choice when the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of another, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals. This is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the ambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out as favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we might sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among the decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected utility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of each choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest expected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of rho under which an alternative is preferred. We must here take into account not only the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational choices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus, an assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the value of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary. It is sufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to discern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is justifiable.",Artificial Intelligence
209,Updating beliefs with incomplete observations,"Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer in 1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. This is a fundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian networks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating strategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this paper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete observations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with incomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and we use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In general, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior probabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions. This is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the incompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of classification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads to a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for classification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for a class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the more general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much harder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations, when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified.",Artificial Intelligence
210,Updating Probabilities,"As examples such as the Monty Hall puzzle show, applying conditioning to update a probability distribution on a ``naive space'', which does not take into account the protocol used, can often lead to counterintuitive results. Here we examine why. A criterion known as CAR (``coarsening at random'') in the statistical literature characterizes when ``naive'' conditioning in a naive space works. We show that the CAR condition holds rather infrequently, and we provide a procedural characterization of it, by giving a randomized algorithm that generates all and only distributions for which CAR holds. This substantially extends previous characterizations of CAR. We also consider more generalized notions of update such as Jeffrey conditioning and minimizing relative entropy (MRE). We give a generalization of the CAR condition that characterizes when Jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers, and show that there exist some very simple settings in which MRE essentially never gives the right results. This generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained in the literature on CAR and MRE.",Artificial Intelligence
211,Pruning Isomorphic Structural Sub-problems in Configuration,"Configuring consists in simulating the realization of a complex product from a catalog of component parts, using known relations between types, and picking values for object attributes. This highly combinatorial problem in the field of constraint programming has been addressed with a variety of approaches since the foundation system R1(McDermott82). An inherent difficulty in solving configuration problems is the existence of many isomorphisms among interpretations. We describe a formalism independent approach to improve the detection of isomorphisms by configurators, which does not require to adapt the problem model. To achieve this, we exploit the properties of a characteristic subset of configuration problems, called the structural sub-problem, which canonical solutions can be produced or tested at a limited cost. In this paper we present an algorithm for testing the canonicity of configurations, that can be added as a symmetry breaking constraint to any configurator. The cost and efficiency of this canonicity test are given.",Artificial Intelligence
212,"Probabilistic Reasoning as Information Compression by Multiple
  Alignment, Unification and Search: An Introduction and Overview","This article introduces the idea that probabilistic reasoning (PR) may be understood as ""information compression by multiple alignment, unification and search"" (ICMAUS). In this context, multiple alignment has a meaning which is similar to but distinct from its meaning in bio-informatics, while unification means a simple merging of matching patterns, a meaning which is related to but simpler than the meaning of that term in logic.   A software model, SP61, has been developed for the discovery and formation of 'good' multiple alignments, evaluated in terms of information compression. The model is described in outline.   Using examples from the SP61 model, this article describes in outline how the ICMAUS framework can model various kinds of PR including: PR in best-match pattern recognition and information retrieval; one-step 'deductive' and 'abductive' PR; inheritance of attributes in a class hierarchy; chains of reasoning (probabilistic decision networks and decision trees, and PR with 'rules'); geometric analogy problems; nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values; modelling the function of a Bayesian network.",Artificial Intelligence

  in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning","We propose a calculus integrating two calculi well-known in Qualitative Spatial Reasoning (QSR): Frank's projection-based cardinal direction calculus, and a coarser version of Freksa's relative orientation calculus. An original constraint propagation procedure is presented, which implements the interaction between the two integrated calculi. The importance of taking into account the interaction is shown with a real example providing an inconsistent knowledge base, whose inconsistency (a) cannot be detected by reasoning separately about each of the two components of the knowledge, just because, taken separately, each is consistent, but (b) is detected by the proposed algorithm, thanks to the interaction knowledge propagated from each of the two compnents to the other.",Artificial Intelligence
215,A ternary Relation Algebra of directed lines,"We define a ternary Relation Algebra (RA) of relative position relations on two-dimensional directed lines (d-lines for short). A d-line has two degrees of freedom (DFs): a rotational DF (RDF), and a translational DF (TDF). The representation of the RDF of a d-line will be handled by an RA of 2D orientations, CYC_t, known in the literature. A second algebra, TA_t, which will handle the TDF of a d-line, will be defined. The two algebras, CYC_t and TA_t, will constitute, respectively, the translational and the rotational components of the RA, PA_t, of relative position relations on d-lines: the PA_t atoms will consist of those pairs <t,r> of a TA_t atom and a CYC_t atom that are compatible. We present in detail the RA PA_t, with its converse table, its rotation table and its composition tables. We show that a (polynomial) constraint propagation algorithm, known in the literature, is complete for a subset of PA_t relations including almost all of the atomic relations. We will discuss the application scope of the RA, which includes incidence geometry, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), shape representation, localisation in (multi-)robot navigation, and the representation of motion prepositions in NLP (Natural Language Processing). We then compare the RA to existing ones, such as an algebra for reasoning about rectangles parallel to the axes of an (orthogonal) coordinate system, a ``spatial Odyssey'' of Allen's interval algebra, and an algebra for reasoning about 2D segments.",Artificial Intelligence
216,From Statistical Knowledge Bases to Degrees of Belief,"An intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions. Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should be based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations, physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about individuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of random worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many other non-deductive reasoning systems.",Artificial Intelligence

218,Quantifying and Visualizing Attribute Interactions,"Interactions are patterns between several attributes in data that cannot be inferred from any subset of these attributes. While mutual information is a well-established approach to evaluating the interactions between two attributes, we surveyed its generalizations as to quantify interactions between several attributes. We have chosen McGill's interaction information, which has been independently rediscovered a number of times under various names in various disciplines, because of its many intuitively appealing properties. We apply interaction information to visually present the most important interactions of the data. Visualization of interactions has provided insight into the structure of data on a number of domains, identifying redundant attributes and opportunities for constructing new features, discovering unexpected regularities in data, and have helped during construction of predictive models; we illustrate the methods on numerous examples. A machine learning method that disregards interactions may get caught in two traps: myopia is caused by learning algorithms assuming independence in spite of interactions, whereas fragmentation arises from assuming an interaction in spite of independence.",Artificial Intelligence
219,Evidential Force Aggregation,"In this paper we develop an evidential force aggregation method intended for classification of evidential intelligence into recognized force structures.

With this measure we can aggregate on a level-by-level basis, starting from general intelligence to achieve a complete force structure with recognized units on all hierarchical levels.",Artificial Intelligence

221,The Algebra of Utility Inference,Richard Cox [1] set the axiomatic foundations of probable inference and the algebra of propositions. He showed that consistency within these axioms requires certain rules for updating belief. In this paper we use the analogy between probability and utility introduced in [2] to propose an axiomatic foundation for utility inference and the algebra of preferences. We show that consistency within these axioms requires certain rules for updating preference. We discuss a class of utility functions that stems from the axioms of utility inference and show that this class is the basic building block for any general multiattribute utility function. We use this class of utility functions together with the algebra of preferences to construct utility functions represented by logical operations on the attributes.,Artificial Intelligence
222,An information theory for preferences,"Recent literature in the last Maximum Entropy workshop introduced an analogy between cumulative probability distributions and normalized utility functions. Based on this analogy, a utility density function can de defined as the derivative of a normalized utility function. A utility density function is non-negative and integrates to unity. These two properties form the basis of a correspondence between utility and probability. A natural application of this analogy is a maximum entropy principle to assign maximum entropy utility values. Maximum entropy utility interprets many of the common utility functions based on the preference information needed for their assignment, and helps assign utility values based on partial preference information. This paper reviews maximum entropy utility and introduces further results that stem from the duality between probability and utility.",Artificial Intelligence
223,"Abductive Logic Programs with Penalization: Semantics, Complexity and
  Implementation","Abduction, first proposed in the setting of classical logics, has been studied with growing interest in the logic programming area during the last years.   In this paper we study abduction with penalization in the logic programming framework. This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously analyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant problems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal model for abduction with penalization over logic programs, which extends the abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge representation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive framework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from different domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning; their encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We thoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in the context of abduction with penalization from logic programs. Finally, we implement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the DLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from abduction problems with penalties into logic programs with weak constraints. We prove that this approach is sound and complete.",Artificial Intelligence

We propose two ``native'' local-search solvers for theories in the extended language. We also describe techniques to reduce the problem to standard propositional satisfiability and allow us to use off-the-shelf SAT solvers. We study these methods experimentally. Our general finding is that native solvers designed specifically for the extended language perform better than indirect methods relying on SAT solvers.",Artificial Intelligence

227,Parametric Connectives in Disjunctive Logic Programming,"Disjunctive Logic Programming (\DLP) is an advanced formalism for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR). \DLP is very expressive in a precise mathematical sense: it allows to express every property of finite structures that is decidable in the complexity class $\SigmaP{2}$ ($\NP^{\NP}$). Importantly, the \DLP encodings are often simple and natural.   In this paper, we single out some limitations of \DLP for KRR, which cannot naturally express problems where the size of the disjunction is not known ``a priori'' (like N-Coloring), but it is part of the input. To overcome these limitations, we further enhance the knowledge modelling abilities of \DLP, by extending this language by {\em Parametric Connectives (OR and AND)}. These connectives allow us to represent compactly the disjunction/conjunction of a set of atoms having a given property. We formally define the semantics of the new language, named $DLP^{\bigvee,\bigwedge}$ and we show the usefulness of the new constructs on relevant knowledge-based problems. We address implementation issues and discuss related works.",Artificial Intelligence

232,"Integrating existing cone-shaped and projection-based cardinal direction
  relations and a TCSP-like decidable generalisation","We consider the integration of existing cone-shaped and projection-based calculi of cardinal direction relations, well-known in QSR. The more general, integrating language we consider is based on convex constraints of the qualitative form $r(x,y)$, $r$ being a cone-shaped or projection-based cardinal direction atomic relation, or of the quantitative form $(\alpha ,\beta)(x,y)$, with $\alpha ,\beta\in [0,2\pi)$ and $(\beta -\alpha)\in [0,\pi ]$: the meaning of the quantitative constraint, in particular, is that point $x$ belongs to the (convex) cone-shaped area rooted at $y$, and bounded by angles $\alpha$ and $\beta$. The general form of a constraint is a disjunction of the form $[r_1\vee...\vee r_{n_1}\vee (\alpha_1,\beta_1)\vee...\vee (\alpha _{n_2},\beta_{n_2})](x,y)$, with $r_i(x,y)$, $i=1... n_1$, and $(\alpha _i,\beta_i)(x,y)$, $i=1... n_2$, being convex constraints as described above: the meaning of such a general constraint is that, for some $i=1... n_1$, $r_i(x,y)$ holds, or, for some $i=1... n_2$, $(\alpha_i,\beta_i)(x,y)$ holds. A conjunction of such general constraints is a $\tcsp$-like CSP, which we will refer to as an $\scsp$ (Spatial Constraint Satisfaction Problem). An effective solution search algorithm for an $\scsp$ will be described, which uses (1) constraint propagation, based on a composition operation to be defined, as the filtering method during the search, and (2) the Simplex algorithm, guaranteeing completeness, at the leaves of the search tree. The approach is particularly suited for large-scale high-level vision, such as, e.g., satellite-like surveillance of a geographic area.",Artificial Intelligence

The rich variety of technical approaches to solving configuration problems (CLP(FD), CC(FD), DCSP, Terminological systems, constraint programs with set variables ...) is a source of difficulty. No universally accepted formal language exists for communicating about OOCPs, which makes the comparison of systems difficult. We present here a Z based specification of OOCPs which avoids the falltrap of hidden object semantics. The object system is part of the specification, and captures all of the most advanced notions from the object oriented modeling standard UML. The paper illustrates these issues and the conciseness and precision of Z by the specification of a working OOCP that solves an historical AI problem : parsing a context free grammar. Being written in Z, an OOCP specification also supports formal proofs. The whole builds the foundation of an adaptative and evolving framework for communicating about constrained object models and programs.",Artificial Intelligence

One of them, due to Lifschitz, Tang and Turner, allows the bodies and heads of rules to contain nested expressions. The other, due to Niemela and Simons, uses weight constraints. We show that there is a simple, modular translation from the language of weight constraints into the language of nested expressions that preserves the program's answer sets. Nested expressions can be eliminated from the result of this translation in favor of additional atoms. The translation makes it possible to compute answer sets for some programs with weight constraints using satisfiability solvers, and to prove the strong equivalence of programs with weight constraints using the logic of here-and there.",Artificial Intelligence
236,On the Expressibility of Stable Logic Programming,"(We apologize for pidgin LaTeX) Schlipf \cite{sch91} proved that Stable Logic Programming (SLP) solves all $\mathit{NP}$ decision problems. We extend Schlipf's result to prove that SLP solves all search problems in the class $\mathit{NP}$. Moreover, we do this in a uniform way as defined in \cite{mt99}. Specifically, we show that there is a single $\mathrm{DATALOG}^{\neg}$ program $P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ such that given any Turing machine $M$, any polynomial $p$ with non-negative integer coefficients and any input $\sigma$ of size $n$ over a fixed alphabet $\Sigma$, there is an extensional database $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma}$ such that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the stable models of $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma} \cup P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ and the accepting computations of the machine $M$ that reach the final state in at most $p(n)$ steps. Moreover, $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma}$ can be computed in polynomial time from $p$, $\sigma$ and the description of $M$ and the decoding of such accepting computations from its corresponding stable model of $\mathit{edb}_{M,p,\sigma} \cup P_{\mathit{Trg}}$ can be computed in linear time.

238,Recycling Computed Answers in Rewrite Systems for Abduction,"In rule-based systems, goal-oriented computations correspond naturally to the possible ways that an observation may be explained. In some applications, we need to compute explanations for a series of observations with the same domain. The question whether previously computed answers can be recycled arises. A yes answer could result in substantial savings of repeated computations. For systems based on classic logic, the answer is YES. For nonmonotonic systems however, one tends to believe that the answer should be NO, since recycling is a form of adding information. In this paper, we show that computed answers can always be recycled, in a nontrivial way, for the class of rewrite procedures that we proposed earlier for logic programs with negation.

In recent years many successful ML applications have been developed, such as datamining programs, information-filtering systems, etc. Although ML algorithms allow the detection and extraction of interesting patterns of data for several kinds of problems, most of these algorithms are based on quantitative reasoning, as they rely on training data in order to infer so-called target functions.   In the last years defeasible argumentation has proven to be a sound setting to formalize common-sense qualitative reasoning. This approach can be combined with other inference techniques, such as those provided by machine learning theory.

In particular, we show that stable model semantics can be defined entirely as an extension of the Kripke-Kleene semantics. Indeed, we show that the closed world assumption can be seen as an additional source of `falsehood' to be added cumulatively to the Kripke-Kleene semantics.

We study a software agent which develops in a network a representation of its simple environment which captures and integrates the relationships between agent and environment through a closure mechanism. The inclusion of a variable behavior modifier allows better representation development. This can be confirmed with an internal description of the closure mechanism, and with an external description of the properties of the representation network.",Artificial Intelligence

246,"A Comparative Study of Fuzzy Classification Methods on Breast Cancer
  Data","In this paper, we examine the performance of four fuzzy rule generation methods on Wisconsin breast cancer data. The first method generates fuzzy if then rules using the mean and the standard deviation of attribute values. The second approach generates fuzzy if then rules using the histogram of attributes values. The third procedure generates fuzzy if then rules with certainty of each attribute into homogeneous fuzzy sets. In the fourth approach, only overlapping areas are partitioned. The first two approaches generate a single fuzzy if then rule for each class by specifying the membership function of each antecedent fuzzy set using the information about attribute values of training patterns. The other two approaches are based on fuzzy grids with homogeneous fuzzy partitions of each attribute. The performance of each approach is evaluated on breast cancer data sets. Simulation results show that the Modified grid approach has a high classification rate of 99.73 %.",Artificial Intelligence
247,Intelligent Systems: Architectures and Perspectives,"The integration of different learning and adaptation techniques to overcome individual limitations and to achieve synergetic effects through the hybridization or fusion of these techniques has, in recent years, contributed to a large number of new intelligent system designs. Computational intelligence is an innovative framework for constructing intelligent hybrid architectures involving Neural Networks (NN), Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS), Probabilistic Reasoning (PR) and derivative free optimization techniques such as Evolutionary Computation (EC). Most of these hybridization approaches, however, follow an ad hoc design methodology, justified by success in certain application domains. Due to the lack of a common framework it often remains difficult to compare the various hybrid systems conceptually and to evaluate their performance comparatively. This chapter introduces the different generic architectures for integrating intelligent systems. The designing aspects and perspectives of different hybrid archirectures like NN-FIS, EC-FIS, EC-NN, FIS-PR and NN-FIS-EC systems are presented. Some conclusions are also provided towards the end.",Artificial Intelligence

The soft computing methods considered are an evolving fuzzy neural network (EFuNN) and an artificial neural network (ANN) trained using scaled conjugate gradient algorithm (CGA) and backpropagation (BP) algorithm. The forecast accuracy is compared with the forecasts used by Victorian Power Exchange (VPX) and the actual energy demand.

We further focus the review on the different types of fused neuro-fuzzy systems and citing the advantages and disadvantages of each model.",Artificial Intelligence
250,Is Neural Network a Reliable Forecaster on Earth? A MARS Query!,"Long-term rainfall prediction is a challenging task especially in the modern world where we are facing the major environmental problem of global warming. In general, climate and rainfall are highly non-linear phenomena in nature exhibiting what is known as the butterfly effect. While some regions of the world are noticing a systematic decrease in annual rainfall, others notice increases in flooding and severe storms. The global nature of this phenomenon is very complicated and requires sophisticated computer modeling and simulation to predict accurately. In this paper, we report a performance analysis for Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)and artificial neural networks for one month ahead prediction of rainfall. To evaluate the prediction efficiency, we made use of 87 years of rainfall data in Kerala state, the southern part of the Indian peninsula situated at latitude -longitude pairs (8o29'N - 76o57' E). We used an artificial neural network trained using the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm. The neural network and MARS were trained with 40 years of rainfall data.

For classifying the images using DCT we used two popular soft computing techniques namely neurocomputing and neuro-fuzzy computing. We used a feedforward neural network trained using the backpropagation learning and an evolving fuzzy neural network to classify the textures. The soft computing models were trained using 80% of the texture data and remaining was used for testing and validation purposes. A performance comparison was made among the soft computing models for the texture classification problem. We also analyzed the effects of prolonged training of neural networks. It is observed that the proposed neuro-fuzzy model performed better than neural network.",Artificial Intelligence

However, the problem of sorting signed permutation can be solved easily. Fast algorithms have been developed both for finding the sorting sequence and finding the reversal distance of signed permutation. In this paper, we present a way to view the problem of sorting unsigned permutation as signed permutation.

Experiment results reveal that all the connectionist paradigms considered could represent the stock indices behavior very accurately.",Artificial Intelligence

258,The Largest Compatible Subset Problem for Phylogenetic Data,"The phylogenetic tree construction is to infer the evolutionary relationship between species from the experimental data. However, the experimental data are often imperfect and conflicting each others. Therefore, it is important to extract the motif from the imperfect data. The largest compatible subset problem is that, given a set of experimental data, we want to discard the minimum such that the remaining is compatible. The largest compatible subset problem can be viewed as the vertex cover problem in the graph theory that has been proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Evolutionary Computing (EC) method for this problem. The proposed method combines the EC approach and the algorithmic approach for special structured graphs. As a result, the complexity of the problem is dramatically reduced. Experiments were performed on randomly generated graphs with different edge densities. The vertex covers produced by the proposed method were then compared to the vertex covers produced by a 2-approximation algorithm. The experimental results showed that the proposed method consistently outperformed a classical 2- approximation algorithm. Furthermore, a significant improvement was found when the graph density was small.",Artificial Intelligence

  Monitoring Systems","In a universe with a single currency, there would be no foreign exchange market, no foreign exchange rates, and no foreign exchange. Over the past twenty-five years, the way the market has performed those tasks has changed enormously. The need for intelligent monitoring systems has become a necessity to keep track of the complex forex market. The vast currency market is a foreign concept to the average individual. However, once it is broken down into simple terms, the average individual can begin to understand the foreign exchange market and use it as a financial instrument for future investing. In this paper, we attempt to compare the performance of hybrid soft computing and hard computing techniques to predict the average monthly forex rates one month ahead.

269,Regression with respect to sensing actions and partial states,"In this paper, we present a state-based regression function for planning domains where an agent does not have complete information and may have sensing actions. We consider binary domains and employ the 0-approximation [Son & Baral 2001] to define the regression function. In binary domains, the use of 0-approximation means using 3-valued states. Although planning using this approach is incomplete with respect to the full semantics, we adopt it to have a lower complexity. We prove the soundness and completeness of our regression formulation with respect to the definition of progression. More specifically, we show that (i) a plan obtained through regression for a planning problem is indeed a progression solution of that planning problem, and that (ii) for each plan found through progression, using regression one obtains that plan or an equivalent one. We then develop a conditional planner that utilizes our regression function.

  Programming","We will try to tackle both the theoretical and practical aspects of a very important problem in chess programming as stated in the title of this article - the issue of draw detection by move repetition. The standard approach that has so far been employed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional matrices in original and compressed format as well as on the implementation of the so-called bitboard format.   The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors.

We show that two well known search strategies, Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS) and Iterative Broadening (IB), can be seen as special cases of DBS. First we present a tuning of DBS that visits the same search nodes as IB, but avoids restarts. Then we compare both theoretically and computationally DBS and LDS using the same heuristic. We prove that DBS has a higher probability of being successful than LDS on a comparable number of nodes, under realistic assumptions. Experiments on a constraint satisfaction problem and an optimization problem show that DBS is indeed very effective if compared to LDS.",Artificial Intelligence

To this end, we group together values in a tie, branch on this sub-domain, and defer the decision among them to lower levels of the search tree. We show theoretically and experimentally that this simple modification can dramatically improve the efficiency of the search strategy.

Exploiting the ranking, we generate, in a Limited Discrepancy Search tree, the most promising subproblems first. An interesting result is that reduced costs provide a very precise ranking that allows to almost always find the optimal solution in the first generated subproblem, even if its dimension is significantly smaller than that of the original problem. Concerning the proof of optimality, we exploit a way to increase the lower bound for subproblems at higher discrepancies.

PCR1 and WAO are particular cases of WO (the Weighted Operator) because the conflicting mass is redistributed with respect to some weighting factors. In this first PCR rule, the proportionalization is done for each non-empty set with respect to the non-zero sum of its corresponding mass matrix - instead of its mass column average as in WAO, but the results are the same as Ph. Smets has pointed out. Also, we extend WAO (which herein gives no solution) for the degenerate case when all column sums of all non-empty sets are zero, and then the conflicting mass is transferred to the non-empty disjunctive form of all non-empty sets together; but if this disjunctive form happens to be empty, then one considers an open world (i.e. the frame of discernment might contain new hypotheses) and thus all conflicting mass is transferred to the empty set. In addition to WAO, we propose a general formula for PCR1 (WAO for non-degenerate cases).",Artificial Intelligence

  Scheme in Evolutionary Algorithms","Boltzmann selection is an important selection mechanism in evolutionary algorithms as it has theoretical properties which help in theoretical analysis. However, Boltzmann selection is not used in practice because a good annealing schedule for the `inverse temperature' parameter is lacking. In this paper we propose a Cauchy annealing schedule for Boltzmann selection scheme based on a hypothesis that selection-strength should increase as evolutionary process goes on and distance between two selection strengths should decrease for the process to converge. To formalize these aspects, we develop formalism for selection mechanisms using fitness distributions and give an appropriate measure for selection-strength. In this paper, we prove an important result, by which we derive an annealing schedule called Cauchy annealing schedule. We demonstrate the novelty of proposed annealing schedule using simulations in the framework of genetic algorithms.",Artificial Intelligence
283,Proportional Conflict Redistribution Rules for Information Fusion,"In this paper we propose five versions of a Proportional Conflict Redistribution rule (PCR) for information fusion together with several examples. From PCR1 to PCR2, PCR3, PCR4, PCR5 one increases the complexity of the rules and also the exactitude of the redistribution of conflicting masses. PCR1 restricted from the hyper-power set to the power set and without degenerate cases gives the same result as the Weighted Average Operator (WAO) proposed recently by J{\o}sang, Daniel and Vannoorenberghe but does not satisfy the neutrality property of vacuous belief assignment. That's why improved PCR rules are proposed in this paper. PCR4 is an improvement of minC and Dempster's rules. The PCR rules redistribute the conflicting mass, after the conjunctive rule has been applied, proportionally with some functions depending on the masses assigned to their corresponding columns in the mass matrix. There are infinitely many ways these functions (weighting factors) can be chosen depending on the complexity one wants to deal with in specific applications and fusion systems.

The first normal form, called the {\em kernel} of the program, is useful for studying existence and number of answer sets. A kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics, which are those that directly affect the existence of answer sets. The body of rules is composed of negative literals only. Thus, the kernel form tends to be significantly more compact than other formulations. Also, it is possible to check consistency of kernel programs in terms of colorings of the Extended Dependency Graph program representation which we previously developed. The second normal form is called {\em 3-kernel.} A 3-kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics. Rules in 3-kernel programs have at most two conditions, and each rule either belongs to a cycle, or defines a connection between cycles. 3-kernel programs may have positive conditions. The 3-kernel normal form is very useful for the static analysis of program consistency, i.e., the syntactic characterization of existence of answer sets. This result can be obtained thanks to a novel graph-like representation of programs, called Cycle Graph which presented in the companion article \cite{Cos04b}.",Artificial Intelligence
287,"An In-Depth Look at Information Fusion Rules & the Unification of Fusion
  Theories","This paper may look like a glossary of the fusion rules and we also introduce new ones presenting their formulas and examples: Conjunctive, Disjunctive, Exclusive Disjunctive, Mixed Conjunctive-Disjunctive rules, Conditional rule, Dempster's, Yager's, Smets' TBM rule, Dubois-Prade's, Dezert-Smarandache classical and hybrid rules, Murphy's average rule, Inagaki-Lefevre-Colot-Vannoorenberghe Unified Combination rules [and, as particular cases: Iganaki's parameterized rule, Weighting Average Operator, minC (M. Daniel), and newly Proportional Conflict Redistribution rules (Smarandache-Dezert) among which PCR5 is the most exact way of redistribution of the conflicting mass to non-empty sets following the path of the conjunctive rule], Zhang's Center Combination rule, Convolutive x-Averaging, Consensus Operator (Josang), Cautious Rule (Smets), ?-junctions rules (Smets), etc. and three new T-norm & T-conorm rules adjusted from fuzzy and neutrosophic sets to information fusion (Tchamova-Smarandache). Introducing the degree of union and degree of inclusion with respect to the cardinal of sets not with the fuzzy set point of view, besides that of intersection, many fusion rules can be improved. There are corner cases where each rule might have difficulties working or may not get an expected result.",Artificial Intelligence
288,Intransitivity and Vagueness,"There are many examples in the literature that suggest that indistinguishability is intransitive, despite the fact that the indistinguishability relation is typically taken to be an equivalence relation (and thus transitive). It is shown that if the uncertainty perception and the question of when an agent reports that two things are indistinguishable are both carefully modeled, the problems disappear, and indistinguishability can indeed be taken to be an equivalence relation. Moreover, this model also suggests a logic of vagueness that seems to solve many of the problems related to vagueness discussed in the philosophical literature. In particular, it is shown here how the logic can handle the sorites paradox.",Artificial Intelligence

  Asynchronous Systems","A careful analysis of conditioning in the Sleeping Beauty problem is done, using the formal model for reasoning about knowledge and probability developed by Halpern and Tuttle. While the Sleeping Beauty problem has been viewed as revealing problems with conditioning in the presence of imperfect recall, the analysis done here reveals that the problems are not so much due to imperfect recall as to asynchrony. The implications of this analysis for van Fraassen's Reflection Principle and Savage's Sure-Thing Principle are considered.",Artificial Intelligence
290,Bounded Input Bounded Predefined Control Bounded Output,"The paper is an attempt to generalize a methodology, which is similar to the bounded-input bounded-output method currently widely used for the system stability studies. The presented earlier methodology allows decomposition of input space into bounded subspaces and defining for each subspace its bounding surface. It also defines a corresponding predefined control, which maps any point of a bounded input into a desired bounded output subspace. This methodology was improved by providing a mechanism for the fast defining a bounded surface. This paper presents enhanced bounded-input bounded-predefined-control bounded-output approach, which provides adaptability feature to the control and allows transferring of a controlled system along a suboptimal trajectory.",Artificial Intelligence
291,"Generating Conditional Probabilities for Bayesian Networks: Easing the
  Knowledge Acquisition Problem","The number of probability distributions required to populate a conditional probability table (CPT) in a Bayesian network, grows exponentially with the number of parent-nodes associated with that table. If the table is to be populated through knowledge elicited from a domain expert then the sheer magnitude of the task forms a considerable cognitive barrier. In this paper we devise an algorithm to populate the CPT while easing the extent of knowledge acquisition. The input to the algorithm consists of a set of weights that quantify the relative strengths of the influences of the parent-nodes on the child-node, and a set of probability distributions the number of which grows only linearly with the number of associated parent-nodes. These are elicited from the domain expert. The set of probabilities are obtained by taking into consideration the heuristics that experts use while arriving at probabilistic estimations. The algorithm is used to populate the CPT by computing appropriate weighted sums of the elicited distributions. We invoke the methods of information geometry to demonstrate how these weighted sums capture the expert's judgemental strategy.",Artificial Intelligence
292,Comparing Multi-Target Trackers on Different Force Unit Levels,"Consider the problem of tracking a set of moving targets. Apart from the tracking result, it is often important to know where the tracking fails, either to steer sensors to that part of the state-space, or to inform a human operator about the status and quality of the obtained information. An intuitive quality measure is the correlation between two tracking results based on uncorrelated observations. In the case of Bayesian trackers such a correlation measure could be the Kullback-Leibler difference.   We focus on a scenario with a large number of military units moving in some terrain. The units are observed by several types of sensors and ""meta-sensors"" with force aggregation capabilities. The sensors register units of different size. Two separate multi-target probability hypothesis density (PHD) particle filters are used to track some type of units (e.g., companies) and their sub-units (e.g., platoons), respectively, based on observations of units of those sizes. Each observation is used in one filter only.   Although the state-space may well be the same in both filters, the posterior PHD distributions are not directly comparable -- one unit might correspond to three or four spatially distributed sub-units. Therefore, we introduce a mapping function between distributions for different unit size, based on doctrine knowledge of unit configuration.   The mapped distributions can now be compared -- locally or globally -- using some measure, which gives the correlation between two PHD distributions in a bounded volume of the state-space. To locate areas where the tracking fails, a discretized quality map of the state-space can be generated by applying the measure locally to different parts of the space.",Artificial Intelligence
293,Extremal optimization for sensor report pre-processing,"We describe the recently introduced extremal optimization algorithm and apply it to target detection and association problems arising in pre-processing for multi-target tracking.   Here we consider the problem of pre-processing for multiple target tracking when the number of sensor reports received is very large and arrives in large bursts. In this case, it is sometimes necessary to pre-process reports before sending them to tracking modules in the fusion system. The pre-processing step associates reports to known tracks (or initializes new tracks for reports on objects that have not been seen before). It could also be used as a pre-process step before clustering, e.g., in order to test how many clusters to use.   The pre-processing is done by solving an approximate version of the original problem. In this approximation, not all pair-wise conflicts are calculated. The approximation relies on knowing how many such pair-wise conflicts that are necessary to compute. To determine this, results on phase-transitions occurring when coloring (or clustering) large random instances of a particular graph ensemble are used.",Artificial Intelligence
294,"The Combination of Paradoxical, Uncertain, and Imprecise Sources of
  Information based on DSmT and Neutro-Fuzzy Inference","The management and combination of uncertain, imprecise, fuzzy and even paradoxical or high conflicting sources of information has always been, and still remains today, of primal importance for the development of reliable modern information systems involving artificial reasoning. In this chapter, we present a survey of our recent theory of plausible and paradoxical reasoning, known as Dezert-Smarandache Theory (DSmT) in the literature, developed for dealing with imprecise, uncertain and paradoxical sources of information. We focus our presentation here rather on the foundations of DSmT, and on the two important new rules of combination, than on browsing specific applications of DSmT available in literature. Several simple examples are given throughout the presentation to show the efficiency and the generality of this new approach. The last part of this chapter concerns the presentation of the neutrosophic logic, the neutro-fuzzy inference and its connection with DSmT. Fuzzy logic and neutrosophic logic are useful tools in decision making after fusioning the information using the DSm hybrid rule of combination of masses.",Artificial Intelligence

  second-order Hidden Markov Models","In this paper, we propose a new method based on Hidden Markov Models to interpret temporal sequences of sensor data from mobile robots to automatically detect features. Hidden Markov Models have been used for a long time in pattern recognition, especially in speech recognition. Their main advantages over other methods (such as neural networks) are their ability to model noisy temporal signals of variable length. We show in this paper that this approach is well suited for interpretation of temporal sequences of mobile-robot sensor data. We present two distinct experiments and results: the first one in an indoor environment where a mobile robot learns to detect features like open doors or T-intersections, the second one in an outdoor environment where a different mobile robot has to identify situations like climbing a hill or crossing a rock.",Artificial Intelligence

297,"Towards Automated Integration of Guess and Check Programs in Answer Set
  Programming: A Meta-Interpreter and Applications","Answer set programming (ASP) with disjunction offers a powerful tool for declaratively representing and solving hard problems. Many NP-complete problems can be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise and intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical ""guess and check"" nature of NP problems: The property is encoded in a way such that polynomial size certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. However, the problem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) is beyond NP, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. While these problems also have a clear ""guess and check"" structure, finding an encoding in a DLP reflecting this structure may sometimes be a non-obvious task, in particular if the ""check"" itself is a coNP-complete problem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and check programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check program. In this paper, we present general transformations of head-cycle free (extended) disjunctive logic programs into stratified and positive (extended) disjunctive logic programs based on meta-interpretation techniques. The answer sets of the original and the transformed program are in simple correspondence, and, moreover, inconsistency of the original program is indicated by a designated answer set of the transformed program. Our transformations facilitate the integration of separate ""guess"" and ""check"" programs, which are often easy to obtain, automatically into a single disjunctive logic program. Our results complement recent results on meta-interpretation in ASP, and extend methods and techniques for a declarative ""guess and check"" problem solving paradigm through ASP.",Artificial Intelligence

304,Perspectives for Strong Artificial Life,"This text introduces the twin deadlocks of strong artificial life. Conceptualization of life is a deadlock both because of the existence of a continuum between the inert and the living, and because we only know one instance of life. Computationalism is a second deadlock since it remains a matter of faith. Nevertheless, artificial life realizations quickly progress and recent constructions embed an always growing set of the intuitive properties of life. This growing gap between theory and realizations should sooner or later crystallize in some kind of paradigm shift and then give clues to break the twin deadlocks.",Artificial Intelligence

  Electroencephalograms","In this chapter we describe new neural-network techniques developed for visual mining clinical electroencephalograms (EEGs), the weak electrical potentials invoked by brain activity. These techniques exploit fruitful ideas of Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH). Section 2 briefly describes the standard neural-network techniques which are able to learn well-suited classification modes from data presented by relevant features. Section 3 introduces an evolving cascade neural network technique which adds new input nodes as well as new neurons to the network while the training error decreases. This algorithm is applied to recognize artifacts in the clinical EEGs. Section 4 presents the GMDH-type polynomial networks learnt from data. We applied this technique to distinguish the EEGs recorded from an Alzheimer and a healthy patient as well as recognize EEG artifacts.

Finally we discuss perspectives of applying the neural-network techniques to clinical EEGs.",Artificial Intelligence
306,"Estimating Classification Uncertainty of Bayesian Decision Tree
  Technique on Financial Data","Bayesian averaging over classification models allows the uncertainty of classification outcomes to be evaluated, which is of crucial importance for making reliable decisions in applications such as financial in which risks have to be estimated. The uncertainty of classification is determined by a trade-off between the amount of data available for training, the diversity of a classifier ensemble and the required performance. The interpretability of classification models can also give useful information for experts responsible for making reliable classifications. For this reason Decision Trees (DTs) seem to be attractive classification models. The required diversity of the DT ensemble can be achieved by using the Bayesian model averaging all possible DTs. In practice, the Bayesian approach can be implemented on the base of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of random sampling from the posterior distribution. For sampling large DTs, the MCMC method is extended by Reversible Jump technique which allows inducing DTs under given priors. For the case when the prior information on the DT size is unavailable, the sweeping technique defining the prior implicitly reveals a better performance. Within this Chapter we explore the classification uncertainty of the Bayesian MCMC techniques on some datasets from the StatLog Repository and real financial data. The classification uncertainty is compared within an Uncertainty Envelope technique dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability. This technique provides realistic estimates of the classification uncertainty which can be easily interpreted in statistical terms with the aim of risk evaluation.",Artificial Intelligence
307,"Comparison of the Bayesian and Randomised Decision Tree Ensembles within
  an Uncertainty Envelope Technique","Multiple Classifier Systems (MCSs) allow evaluation of the uncertainty of classification outcomes that is of crucial importance for safety critical applications. The uncertainty of classification is determined by a trade-off between the amount of data available for training, the classifier diversity and the required performance. The interpretability of MCSs can also give useful information for experts responsible for making reliable classifications. For this reason Decision Trees (DTs) seem to be attractive classification models for experts. The required diversity of MCSs exploiting such classification models can be achieved by using two techniques, the Bayesian model averaging and the randomised DT ensemble. Both techniques have revealed promising results when applied to real-world problems. In this paper we experimentally compare the classification uncertainty of the Bayesian model averaging with a restarting strategy and the randomised DT ensemble on a synthetic dataset and some domain problems commonly used in the machine learning community. To make the Bayesian DT averaging feasible, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. The classification uncertainty is evaluated within an Uncertainty Envelope technique dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability. Exploring a full posterior distribution, this technique produces realistic estimates which can be easily interpreted in statistical terms. In our experiments we found out that the Bayesian DTs are superior to the randomised DT ensembles within the Uncertainty Envelope technique.",Artificial Intelligence

309,Temporal and Spatial Data Mining with Second-Order Hidden Models,"In the frame of designing a knowledge discovery system, we have developed stochastic models based on high-order hidden Markov models. These models are capable to map sequences of data into a Markov chain in which the transitions between the states depend on the \texttt{n} previous states according to the order of the model. We study the process of achieving information extraction fromspatial and temporal data by means of an unsupervised classification. We use therefore a French national database related to the land use of a region, named Teruti, which describes the land use both in the spatial and temporal domain. Land-use categories (wheat, corn, forest, ...) are logged every year on each site regularly spaced in the region. They constitute a temporal sequence of images in which we look for spatial and temporal dependencies. The temporal segmentation of the data is done by means of a second-order Hidden Markov Model (\hmmd) that appears to have very good capabilities to locate stationary segments, as shown in our previous work in speech recognition. Thespatial classification is performed by defining a fractal scanning ofthe images with the help of a Hilbert-Peano curve that introduces atotal order on the sites, preserving the relation ofneighborhood between the sites. We show that the \hmmd performs aclassification that is meaningful for the agronomists.Spatial and temporal classification may be achieved simultaneously by means of a 2 levels \hmmd that measures the \aposteriori probability to map a temporal sequence of images onto a set of hidden classes.",Artificial Intelligence
310,An ontological approach to the construction of problem-solving models,"Our ongoing work aims at defining an ontology-centered approach for building expertise models for the CommonKADS methodology. This approach (which we have named ""OntoKADS"") is founded on a core problem-solving ontology which distinguishes between two conceptualization levels: at an object level, a set of concepts enable us to define classes of problem-solving situations, and at a meta level, a set of meta-concepts represent modeling primitives. In this article, our presentation of OntoKADS will focus on the core ontology and, in particular, on roles - the primitive situated at the interface between domain knowledge and reasoning, and whose ontological status is still much debated. We first propose a coherent, global, ontological framework which enables us to account for this primitive. We then show how this novel characterization of the primitive allows definition of new rules for the construction of expertise models.",Artificial Intelligence

314,ATNoSFERES revisited,"ATNoSFERES is a Pittsburgh style Learning Classifier System (LCS) in which the rules are represented as edges of an Augmented Transition Network. Genotypes are strings of tokens of a stack-based language, whose execution builds the labeled graph. The original ATNoSFERES, using a bitstring to represent the language tokens, has been favorably compared in previous work to several Michigan style LCSs architectures in the context of Non Markov problems. Several modifications of ATNoSFERES are proposed here: the most important one conceptually being a representational change: each token is now represented by an integer, hence the genotype is a string of integers; several other modifications of the underlying grammar language are also proposed. The resulting ATNoSFERES-II is validated on several standard animat Non Markov problems, on which it outperforms all previously published results in the LCS literature. The reasons for these improvement are carefully analyzed, and some assumptions are proposed on the underlying mechanisms in order to explain these good results.",Artificial Intelligence

  Approach","Clustering is a widely used technique in data mining applications for discovering patterns in underlying data. Most traditional clustering algorithms are limited to handling datasets that contain either numeric or categorical attributes. However, datasets with mixed types of attributes are common in real life data mining applications. In this paper, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer technique to solve this problem. First, the original mixed dataset is divided into two sub-datasets: the pure categorical dataset and the pure numeric dataset. Next, existing well established clustering algorithms designed for different types of datasets are employed to produce corresponding clusters. Last, the clustering results on the categorical and numeric dataset are combined as a categorical dataset, on which the categorical data clustering algorithm is used to get the final clusters. Our contribution in this paper is to provide an algorithm framework for the mixed attributes clustering problem, in which existing clustering algorithms can be easily integrated, the capabilities of different kinds of clustering algorithms and characteristics of different types of datasets could be fully exploited. Comparisons with other clustering algorithms on real life datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach.",Artificial Intelligence

Its application leads to the elaboration of a semi-informal ontology, which is independent of knowledge representation languages. We recently enriched the OntoSpec methodology by endowing it with a new resource, the DOLCE top-level ontology defined at the LOA (IST-CNR, Trento, Italy).

Each of these observations can be viewed as providing evidence for or against various hypotheses.

  real-world train timetabling","Train timetabling is a difficult and very tightly constrained combinatorial problem that deals with the construction of train schedules. We focus on the particular problem of local reconstruction of the schedule following a small perturbation, seeking minimisation of the total accumulated delay by adapting times of departure and arrival for each train and allocation of resources (tracks, routing nodes, etc.). We describe a permutation-based evolutionary algorithm that relies on a semi-greedy heuristic to gradually reconstruct the schedule by inserting trains one after the other following the permutation. This algorithm can be hybridised with ILOG commercial MIP programming tool CPLEX in a coarse-grained manner: the evolutionary part is used to quickly obtain a good but suboptimal solution and this intermediate solution is refined using CPLEX. Experimental results are presented on a large real-world case involving more than one million variables and 2 million constraints. Results are surprisingly good as the evolutionary algorithm, alone or hybridised, produces excellent solutions much faster than CPLEX alone.",Artificial Intelligence

326,Evolution of Voronoi based Fuzzy Recurrent Controllers,"A fuzzy controller is usually designed by formulating the knowledge of a human expert into a set of linguistic variables and fuzzy rules. Among the most successful methods to automate the fuzzy controllers development process are evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we propose the Recurrent Fuzzy Voronoi (RFV) model, a representation for recurrent fuzzy systems. It is an extension of the FV model proposed by Kavka and Schoenauer that extends the application domain to include temporal problems. The FV model is a representation for fuzzy controllers based on Voronoi diagrams that can represent fuzzy systems with synergistic rules, fulfilling the $\epsilon$-completeness property and providing a simple way to introduce a priory knowledge. In the proposed representation, the temporal relations are embedded by including internal units that provide feedback by connecting outputs to inputs. These internal units act as memory elements. In the RFV model, the semantic of the internal units can be specified together with the a priori rules. The geometric interpretation of the rules allows the use of geometric variational operators during the evolution. The representation and the algorithms are validated in two problems in the area of system identification and evolutionary robotics.",Artificial Intelligence
327,Branch-and-Prune Search Strategies for Numerical Constraint Solving,"When solving numerical constraints such as nonlinear equations and inequalities, solvers often exploit pruning techniques, which remove redundant value combinations from the domains of variables, at pruning steps. To find the complete solution set, most of these solvers alternate the pruning steps with branching steps, which split each problem into subproblems. This forms the so-called branch-and-prune framework, well known among the approaches for solving numerical constraints. The basic branch-and-prune search strategy that uses domain bisections in place of the branching steps is called the bisection search. In general, the bisection search works well in case (i) the solutions are isolated, but it can be improved further in case (ii) there are continuums of solutions (this often occurs when inequalities are involved). In this paper, we propose a new branch-and-prune search strategy along with several variants, which not only allow yielding better branching decisions in the latter case, but also work as well as the bisection search does in the former case. These new search algorithms enable us to employ various pruning techniques in the construction of inner and outer approximations of the solution set. Our experiments show that these algorithms speed up the solving process often by one order of magnitude or more when solving problems with continuums of solutions, while keeping the same performance as the bisection search when the solutions are isolated.",Artificial Intelligence

  mapping","IS success is a complex concept, and its evaluation is complicated, unstructured and not readily quantifiable. Numerous scientific publications address the issue of success in the IS field as well as in other fields. But, little efforts have been done for processing indeterminacy and uncertainty in success research. This paper shows a formal method for mapping success using Neutrosophic Success Map. This is an emerging tool for processing indeterminacy and uncertainty in success research. EIS success have been analyzed using this tool.",Artificial Intelligence
329,Mathematical Models in Schema Theory,"In this paper, a mathematical schema theory is developed. This theory has three roots: brain theory schemas, grid automata, and block-shemas. In Section 2 of this paper, elements of the theory of grid automata necessary for the mathematical schema theory are presented. In Section 3, elements of brain theory necessary for the mathematical schema theory are presented. In Section 4, other types of schemas are considered. In Section 5, the mathematical schema theory is developed. The achieved level of schema representation allows one to model by mathematical tools virtually any type of schemas considered before, including schemas in neurophisiology, psychology, computer science, Internet technology, databases, logic, and mathematics.",Artificial Intelligence
330,Truecluster: robust scalable clustering with model selection,"Data-based classification is fundamental to most branches of science. While recent years have brought enormous progress in various areas of statistical computing and clustering, some general challenges in clustering remain: model selection, robustness, and scalability to large datasets. We consider the important problem of deciding on the optimal number of clusters, given an arbitrary definition of space and clusteriness. We show how to construct a cluster information criterion that allows objective model selection. Differing from other approaches, our truecluster method does not require specific assumptions about underlying distributions, dissimilarity definitions or cluster models. Truecluster puts arbitrary clustering algorithms into a generic unified (sampling-based) statistical framework. It is scalable to big datasets and provides robust cluster assignments and case-wise diagnostics. Truecluster will make clustering more objective, allows for automation, and will save time and costs. Free R software is available.",Artificial Intelligence
331,"Divide-and-Evolve: a New Memetic Scheme for Domain-Independent Temporal
  Planning","An original approach, termed Divide-and-Evolve is proposed to hybridize Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) with Operational Research (OR) methods in the domain of Temporal Planning Problems (TPPs). Whereas standard Memetic Algorithms use local search methods to improve the evolutionary solutions, and thus fail when the local method stops working on the complete problem, the Divide-and-Evolve approach splits the problem at hand into several, hopefully easier, sub-problems, and can thus solve globally problems that are intractable when directly fed into deterministic OR algorithms. But the most prominent advantage of the Divide-and-Evolve approach is that it immediately opens up an avenue for multi-objective optimization, even though the OR method that is used is single-objective. Proof of concept approach on the standard (single-objective) Zeno transportation benchmark is given, and a small original multi-objective benchmark is proposed in the same Zeno framework to assess the multi-objective capabilities of the proposed methodology, a breakthrough in Temporal Planning.",Artificial Intelligence

333,"Certainty Closure: Reliable Constraint Reasoning with Incomplete or
  Erroneous Data","Constraint Programming (CP) has proved an effective paradigm to model and solve difficult combinatorial satisfaction and optimisation problems from disparate domains. Many such problems arising from the commercial world are permeated by data uncertainty. Existing CP approaches that accommodate uncertainty are less suited to uncertainty arising due to incomplete and erroneous data, because they do not build reliable models and solutions guaranteed to address the user's genuine problem as she perceives it. Other fields such as reliable computation offer combinations of models and associated methods to handle these types of uncertain data, but lack an expressive framework characterising the resolution methodology independently of the model.   We present a unifying framework that extends the CP formalism in both model and solutions, to tackle ill-defined combinatorial problems with incomplete or erroneous data. The certainty closure framework brings together modelling and solving methodologies from different fields into the CP paradigm to provide reliable and efficient approches for uncertain constraint problems. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework on a case study in network diagnosis. We define resolution forms that give generic templates, and their associated operational semantics, to derive practical solution methods for reliable solutions.",Artificial Intelligence
334,Avoiding the Bloat with Stochastic Grammar-based Genetic Programming,"The application of Genetic Programming to the discovery of empirical laws is often impaired by the huge size of the search space, and consequently by the computer resources needed. In many cases, the extreme demand for memory and CPU is due to the massive growth of non-coding segments, the introns. The paper presents a new program evolution framework which combines distribution-based evolution in the PBIL spirit, with grammar-based genetic programming; the information is stored as a probability distribution on the gra mmar rules, rather than in a population. Experiments on a real-world like problem show that this approach gives a practical solution to the problem of intron growth.",Artificial Intelligence

To illustrate the method we present the results obtained on an artificial and a real dataset.,Artificial Intelligence
336,Open Answer Set Programming with Guarded Programs,"Open answer set programming (OASP) is an extension of answer set programming where one may ground a program with an arbitrary superset of the program's constants. We define a fixed point logic (FPL) extension of Clark's completion such that open answer sets correspond to models of FPL formulas and identify a syntactic subclass of programs, called (loosely) guarded programs. Whereas reasoning with general programs in OASP is undecidable, the FPL translation of (loosely) guarded programs falls in the decidable (loosely) guarded fixed point logic (mu(L)GF). Moreover, we reduce normal closed ASP to loosely guarded OASP, enabling for the first time, a characterization of an answer set semantics by muLGF formulas. We further extend the open answer set semantics for programs with generalized literals. Such generalized programs (gPs) have interesting properties, e.g., the ability to express infinity axioms. We restrict the syntax of gPs such that both rules and generalized literals are guarded. Via a translation to guarded fixed point logic, we deduce 2-exptime-completeness of satisfiability checking in such guarded gPs (GgPs). Bound GgPs are restricted GgPs with exptime-complete satisfiability checking, but still sufficiently expressive to optimally simulate computation tree logic (CTL). We translate Datalog lite programs to GgPs, establishing equivalence of GgPs under an open answer set semantics, alternation-free muGF, and Datalog lite.",Artificial Intelligence
337,Metatheory of actions: beyond consistency,"Consistency check has been the only criterion for theory evaluation in logic-based approaches to reasoning about actions. This work goes beyond that and contributes to the metatheory of actions by investigating what other properties a good domain description in reasoning about actions should have. We state some metatheoretical postulates concerning this sore spot. When all postulates are satisfied together we have a modular action theory. Besides being easier to understand and more elaboration tolerant in McCarthy's sense, modular theories have interesting properties. We point out the problems that arise when the postulates about modularity are violated and propose algorithmic checks that can help the designer of an action theory to overcome them.",Artificial Intelligence
338,"Estimation of linear, non-gaussian causal models in the presence of
  confounding latent variables","The estimation of linear causal models (also known as structural equation models) from data is a well-known problem which has received much attention in the past. Most previous work has, however, made an explicit or implicit assumption of gaussianity, limiting the identifiability of the models. We have recently shown (Shimizu et al, 2005; Hoyer et al, 2006) that for non-gaussian distributions the full causal model can be estimated in the no hidden variables case. In this contribution, we discuss the estimation of the model when confounding latent variables are present. Although in this case uniqueness is no longer guaranteed, there is at most a finite set of models which can fit the data. We develop an algorithm for estimating this set, and describe numerical simulations which confirm the theoretical arguments and demonstrate the practical viability of the approach. Full Matlab code is provided for all simulations.",Artificial Intelligence

340,Approximation Algorithms for K-Modes Clustering,"In this paper, we study clustering with respect to the k-modes objective function, a natural formulation of clustering for categorical data. One of the main contributions of this paper is to establish the connection between k-modes and k-median, i.e., the optimum of k-median is at most twice the optimum of k-modes for the same categorical data clustering problem. Based on this observation, we derive a deterministic algorithm that achieves an approximation factor of 2. Furthermore, we prove that the distance measure in k-modes defines a metric. Hence, we are able to extend existing approximation algorithms for metric k-median to k-modes. Empirical results verify the superiority of our method.",Artificial Intelligence
341,Can an Organism Adapt Itself to Unforeseen Circumstances?,"A model of an organism as an autonomous intelligent system has been proposed. This model was used to analyze learning of an organism in various environmental conditions. Processes of learning were divided into two types: strong and weak processes taking place in the absence and the presence of aprioristic information about an object respectively. Weak learning is synonymous to adaptation when aprioristic programs already available in a system (an organism) are started. It was shown that strong learning is impossible for both an organism and any autonomous intelligent system. It was shown also that the knowledge base of an organism cannot be updated. Therefore, all behavior programs of an organism are congenital. A model of a conditioned reflex as a series of consecutive measurements of environmental parameters has been advanced. Repeated measurements are necessary in this case to reduce the error during decision making.",Artificial Intelligence

343,Retraction and Generalized Extension of Computing with Words,"Fuzzy automata, whose input alphabet is a set of numbers or symbols, are a formal model of computing with values. Motivated by Zadeh's paradigm of computing with words rather than numbers, Ying proposed a kind of fuzzy automata, whose input alphabet consists of all fuzzy subsets of a set of symbols, as a formal model of computing with all words. In this paper, we introduce a somewhat general formal model of computing with (some special) words. The new features of the model are that the input alphabet only comprises some (not necessarily all) fuzzy subsets of a set of symbols and the fuzzy transition function can be specified arbitrarily. By employing the methodology of fuzzy control, we establish a retraction principle from computing with words to computing with values for handling crisp inputs and a generalized extension principle from computing with words to computing with all words for handling fuzzy inputs. These principles show that computing with values and computing with all words can be respectively implemented by computing with words. Some algebraic properties of retractions and generalized extensions are addressed as well.",Artificial Intelligence
344,A Knowledge-Based Approach for Selecting Information Sources,"Through the Internet and the World-Wide Web, a vast number of information sources has become available, which offer information on various subjects by different providers, often in heterogeneous formats. This calls for tools and methods for building an advanced information-processing infrastructure. One issue in this area is the selection of suitable information sources in query answering. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this problem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources (prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user query. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of the information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a formal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as well). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a query description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection programs, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured nature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must carefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and furthermore combine it with possible user preferences. A prototype implementation of our approach has been realized exploiting the DLV KR system and its plp front-end for prioritized ELPs. We describe a representative example involving specific movie databases, and report about experimental results.",Artificial Intelligence

We show in a series of robotic experiments which cognitive mechanisms are necessary and sufficient to achieve successful spatial language and why and how perspective alignment can take place, either implicitly or based on explicit marking.",Artificial Intelligence

  Static Causal Laws using Answer Set Programming","We extend the 0-approximation of sensing actions and incomplete information in [Son and Baral 2000] to action theories with static causal laws and prove its soundness with respect to the possible world semantics. We also show that the conditional planning problem with respect to this approximation is NP-complete. We then present an answer set programming based conditional planner, called ASCP, that is capable of generating both conformant plans and conditional plans in the presence of sensing actions, incomplete information about the initial state, and static causal laws. We prove the correctness of our implementation and argue that our planner is sound and complete with respect to the proposed approximation. Finally, we present experimental results comparing ASCP to other planners.",Artificial Intelligence
347,"Approximate Discrete Probability Distribution Representation using a
  Multi-Resolution Binary Tree","Computing and storing probabilities is a hard problem as soon as one has to deal with complex distributions over multiple random variables. The problem of efficient representation of probability distributions is central in term of computational efficiency in the field of probabilistic reasoning. The main problem arises when dealing with joint probability distributions over a set of random variables: they are always represented using huge probability arrays. In this paper, a new method based on binary-tree representation is introduced in order to store efficiently very large joint distributions. Our approach approximates any multidimensional joint distributions using an adaptive discretization of the space. We make the assumption that the lower is the probability mass of a particular region of feature space, the larger is the discretization step. This assumption leads to a very optimized representation in term of time and memory. The other advantages of our approach are the ability to refine dynamically the distribution every time it is needed leading to a more accurate representation of the probability distribution and to an anytime representation of the distribution.",Artificial Intelligence
348,Diagnosability of Fuzzy Discrete Event Systems,"In order to more effectively cope with the real-world problems of vagueness, {\it fuzzy discrete event systems} (FDESs) were proposed recently, and the supervisory control theory of FDESs was developed. In view of the importance of failure diagnosis, in this paper, we present an approach of the failure diagnosis in the framework of FDESs. More specifically: (1) We formalize the definition of diagnosability for FDESs, in which the observable set and failure set of events are {\it fuzzy}, that is, each event has certain degree to be observable and unobservable, and, also, each event may possess different possibility of failure occurring. (2) Through the construction of observability-based diagnosers of FDESs, we investigate its some basic properties. In particular, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosability of FDESs. (3) Some examples serving to illuminate the applications of the diagnosability of FDESs are described. To conclude, some related issues are raised for further consideration.",Artificial Intelligence

Compared with a well-known approach using pairwise objects as training samples, the new algorithm has a reduced complexity and training time. A second novel model, the unimodal model, is also introduced and a parametric version is mapped into neural networks. Several case studies are presented to assert the validity of the proposed models.",Artificial Intelligence
2100,"Security amplification by composition: The case of doubly-iterated,
  ideal ciphers","We investigate, in the Shannon model, the security of constructions corresponding to double and (two-key) triple DES. That is, we consider F_{k1}(F_{k2}(.)) and F_{k1}(F_{k2}^{-1}(F_{k1}(.))) with the component functions being ideal ciphers. This models the resistance of these constructions to ``generic'' attacks like meet in the middle attacks. We obtain the first proof that composition actually increases the security of these constructions in some meaningful sense. We compute a bound on the probability of breaking the double cipher as a function of the number of computations of the base cipher made, and the number of examples of the composed cipher seen, and show that the success probability is the square of that for a single key cipher. The same bound holds for the two-key triple cipher. The first bound is tight and shows that meet in the middle is the best possible generic attack against the double cipher.",Cryptography and Security
2101,Security Policy Specification Using a Graphical Approach,"A security policy states the acceptable actions of an information system, as the actions bear on security. There is a pressing need for organizations to declare their security policies, even informal statements would be better than the current practice. But, formal policy statements are preferable to support (1) reasoning about policies, e.g., for consistency and completeness, (2) automated enforcement of the policy, e.g., using wrappers around legacy systems or after the fact with an intrusion detection system, and (3) other formal manipulation of policies, e.g., the composition of policies. We present LaSCO, the Language for Security Constraints on Objects, in which a policy consists of two parts: the domain (assumptions about the system) and the requirement (what is allowed assuming the domain is satisfied). Thus policies defined in LaSCO have the appearance of conditional access control statements. LaSCO policies are specified as expressions in logic and as directed graphs, giving a visual view of policy. LaSCO has a simple semantics in first order logic (which we provide), thus permitting policies we write, even for complex policies, to be very perspicuous. LaSCO has syntax to express many of the situations we have found to be useful on policies or, more interesting, the composition of policies. LaSCO has an object-oriented structure, permitting it to be useful to describe policies on the objects and methods of an application written in an object-oriented language, in addition to the traditional policies on operating system objects. A LaSCO specification can be automatically translated into executable code that checks an invocation of a program with respect to a policy. The implementation of LaSCO is in Java, and generates wrappers to check Java programs with respect to a policy.",Cryptography and Security

The secrecy achieved is unconditional although we allow an exponentially small probability of error. This is possible due to a protocol for computing the product of two values already shared by means of a homomorphic commitment scheme which appeared originally in a paper of Chaum, Evertse and van de Graaf.",Cryptography and Security

This is done via huge Certificate Revocation Lists which are both inconvenient and expencive. Several improvements to these lists are proposed and in this report we try to analyze them briefly.

  for Security Constraints on Objects","In this dissertation, we present LaSCO, the Language for Security Constraints on Objects, a new approach to expressing security policies using policy graphs and present a method for enforcing policies so expressed. Other approaches for stating security policies fall short of what is desirable with respect to either policy clarity, executability, or the precision with which a policy may be expressed. However, LaSCO is designed to have those three desirable properties of a security policy language as well as: relevance for many different systems, statement of policies at an appropriate level of detail, user friendliness for both casual and expert users, and amenability to formal reasoning. In LaSCO, the constraints of a policy are stated as directed graphs annotated with expressions describing the situation under which the policy applies and what the requirement is. LaSCO may be used for such diverse applications as executing programs, file systems, operating systems, distributed systems, and networks.   Formal operational semantics have been defined for LaSCO. An architecture for implementing LaSCO on any system, is presented along with an implementation of the system-independent portion in Perl. Using this, we have implemented LaSCO for Java programs, preventing Java programs from violating policy. A GUI to facilitate writing policies is provided. We have studied applying LaSCO to a network as viewed by GrIDS, a distributed intrusion detection system for large networks, and propose a design. We conclude that LaSCO has characteristics that enable its use on different types of systems throughout the process of precisely expressing a policy, understanding the implications of a policy, and implementing it on a system.",Cryptography and Security

2109,Anonymous Oblivious Transfer,In this short note we want to introduce {\em anonymous oblivious transfer} a new cryptographic primitive which can be proven to be strictly more powerful than oblivious transfer. We show that all functions can be robustly realized by multi party protocols with {\em anonymous oblivious transfer}. No assumption about possible collusions of cheaters or disruptors have to be made. Furthermore we shortly discuss how to realize anonymous oblivious transfer with oblivious broadcast or by quantum cryptography. The protocol of anonymous oblivious transfer was inspired by a quantum protocol: the anonymous quantum channel.,Cryptography and Security

But all known protocols can be aborted by just one disruptor.   This paper presents more robust solutions for multiparty protocols with oblivious transfer. This additional robustness against disruptors weakens the security of the protocol and the guarantee that the result is correct. We can observe a trade off between robustness against disruption and security and correctness.   We give an application to quantum multiparty protocols. These allow the implementation of oblivious transfer and the protocols of this paper relative to temporary assumptions, i.e., the security increases after the termination of the protocol.",Cryptography and Security

For example, their wealth is above or below a threshold, they voted for a particular candidate, they have a certain disease, etc. The group wants to find out how many of its members posses the property -- without revealing the identities. Unless of course it turns out that all members do or do not have the attribute of interest. However, in all other cases the counting algorithm should guarantee that nobody can find out if a particular individual possesses the property unless all the other N-1 members of the group collude.   The present article describes a method to solve the confidential counting problem with only 3*N-2 pairwise communications, or 2*N broadcasts (the last N-1 pairwise communications are merely to announce the result). The counting algorithm does not require any trusted third parties. All communications between parties involved can be conducted in public without compromising the security of counting.",Cryptography and Security

In this setting, one may simultaneously engage in many interactive proofs, and these proofs may take place in an asynchronous fashion. It is known that zero-knowledge is not necessarily preserved in such an environment; we show that for a large class of protocols, it cannot be preserved.

2114,On Concurrent and Resettable Zero-Knowledge Proofs for NP,"A proof is concurrent zero-knowledge if it remains zero-knowledge when many copies of the proof are run in an asynchronous environment, such as the Internet. It is known that zero-knowledge is not necessarily preserved in such an environment. Designing concurrent zero-knowledge proofs is a fundamental issue in the study of zero-knowledge since known zero-knowledge protocols cannot be run in a realistic modern computing environment. In this paper we present a concurrent zero-knowledge proof systems for all languages in NP. Currently, the proof system we present is the only known proof system that retains the zero-knowledge property when copies of the proof are allowed to run in an asynchronous environment. Our proof system has $\tilde{O}(\log^2 k)$ rounds (for a security parameter $k$), which is almost optimal, as it is shown by Canetti Kilian Petrank and Rosen that black-box concurrent zero-knowledge requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\log k)$ rounds.   Canetti, Goldreich, Goldwasser and Micali introduced the notion of {\em resettable} zero-knowledge, and modified an earlier version of our proof system to obtain the first resettable zero-knowledge proof system. This protocol requires $k^{\theta(1)}$ rounds.

Recent experimental development on algorithmic self-assembly using DNA tiles seem to offer the most promising path toward a potentially useful application of the DNA computing concept. In this paper, we explore new geometries for algorithmic self-assembly, departing from those previously described in the literature.

(2) Clients and servers can use almost the same algorithm. This reduces the implementation costs without accepting replay attacks and abuse of entities as oracles.,Cryptography and Security
2119,Trust enhancement by multiple random beacons,"Random beacons-information sources that broadcast a stream of random digits unknown by anyone beforehand-are useful for various cryptographic purposes. But such beacons can be easily and undetectably sabotaged, so that their output is known beforehand by a dishonest party, who can use this information to defeat the cryptographic protocols supposedly protected by the beacon. We explore a strategy to reduce this hazard by combining the outputs from several noninteracting (eg spacelike-separated) beacons by XORing them together to produce a single digit stream which is more trustworthy than any individual beacon, being random and unpredictable if at least one of the contributing beacons is honest. If the contributing beacons are not spacelike separated, so that a dishonest beacon can overhear and adapt to earlier outputs of other beacons, the beacons' trustworthiness can still be enhanced to a lesser extent by a time sharing strategy. We point out some disadvantages of alternative trust amplification methods based on one-way hash functions.",Cryptography and Security

The network traffic description is synthesized by applying methods of theoretical physics and complex systems theory, to provide a robust approach for network monitoring that detects known intrusions, and supports developing real systems for detection of unknown intrusions.

2121,On non-abelian homomorphic public-key cryptosystems,"An important problem of modern cryptography concerns secret public-key computations in algebraic structures. We construct homomorphic cryptosystems being (secret) epimorphisms f:G --> H, where G, H are (publically known) groups and H is finite. A letter of a message to be encrypted is an element h element of H, while its encryption g element of G is such that f(g)=h. A homomorphic cryptosystem allows one to perform computations (operating in a group G) with encrypted information (without knowing the original message over H).

2127,"Length-Based Attacks for Certain Group Based Encryption Rewriting
  Systems","In this note, we describe a probabilistic attack on public key cryptosystems based on the word/conjugacy problems for finitely presented groups of the type proposed recently by Anshel, Anshel and Goldfeld. In such a scheme, one makes use of the property that in the given group the word problem has a polynomial time solution, while the conjugacy problem has no known polynomial solution. An example is the braid group from topology in which the word problem is solvable in polynomial time while the only known solutions to the conjugacy problem are exponential. The attack in this paper is based on having a canonical representative of each string relative to which a length function may be computed. Hence the term length attack. Such canonical representatives are known to exist for the braid group.",Cryptography and Security
2128,On the Relationship between Strand Spaces and Multi-Agent Systems,"Strand spaces are a popular framework for the analysis of security protocols. Strand spaces have some similarities to a formalism used successfully to model protocols for distributed systems, namely multi-agent systems. We explore the exact relationship between these two frameworks here. It turns out that a key difference is the handling of agents, which are unspecified in strand spaces and explicit in multi-agent systems. We provide a family of translations from strand spaces to multi-agent systems parameterized by the choice of agents in the strand space. We also show that not every multi-agent system of interest can be expressed as a strand space. This reveals a lack of expressiveness in the strand-space framework that can be characterized by our translation. To highlight this lack of expressiveness, we show one simple way in which strand spaces can be extended to model more systems.",Cryptography and Security

Derived from geometric properties of the Euler functions, the Euler function rays, a new ansatz to attack RSA cryptosystems is presented. A resulting, albeit inefficient, algorithm is given. It essentially consists of a loop with starting value determined by the Euler function ray and with step width given by a function $\omega_e(n)$ being a multiple of the order $\mathrm{ord}_n(e)$, where $e$ denotes the public key exponent and $n$ the RSA modulus. For $n=pq$ and an estimate $r<\sqrt{pq}$ for the smaller prime factor $p$, the running time is given by $T(e,n,r) = O((r-p)\ln e \ln n \ln r).$",Cryptography and Security

2132,New Lattice Based Cryptographic Constructions,"We introduce the use of Fourier analysis on lattices as an integral part of a lattice based construction. The tools we develop provide an elegant description of certain Gaussian distributions around lattice points. Our results include two cryptographic constructions which are based on the worst-case hardness of the unique shortest vector problem. The main result is a new public key cryptosystem whose security guarantee is considerably stronger than previous results ($O(n^{1.5})$ instead of $O(n^7)$). This provides the first alternative to Ajtai and Dwork's original 1996 cryptosystem. Our second result is a family of collision resistant hash functions which, apart from improving the security in terms of the unique shortest vector problem, is also the first example of an analysis which is not based on Ajtai's iterative step. Surprisingly, both results are derived from one theorem which presents two indistinguishable distributions on the segment $[0,1)$. It seems that this theorem can have further applications and as an example we mention how it can be used to solve an open problem related to quantum computation.",Cryptography and Security

The graph is described and converted to the form, where colors assigned to vertices form the number with entries from Zn. A secret sharing scheme (SSS) for the graph coloring is proposed. The proposed method is applied to the public-key cryptosystem called ""Polly Cracker"". In this case the graph structure is a public key, while proper 3-colouring of the graph is a private key.

This method allows to encode an image into n shared images so that only qualified subsets of k or more shares can recover the secret image, but any k-1 or fewer of them gain no information about the original image. The main characteristics of this new scheme are: each shared image has the same size that the original one, and the recovered image is exactly the same than the secret image; i.e., there is no loss of resolution.",Cryptography and Security
2136,Pseudorandom number generation by $p$-adic ergodic transformations,"The paper study counter-dependent pseudorandom generators; the latter are generators such that their state transition function (and output function) is being modified dynamically while working: For such a generator the recurrence sequence of states satisfies a congruence $x_{i+1}\equiv f_i(x_i)\pmod{2^n}$, while its output sequence is of the form $z_{i}=F_i(u_i)$. The paper introduces techniques and constructions that enable one to compose generators that output uniformly distributed sequences of a maximum period length and with high linear and 2-adic spans. The corresponding stream chipher is provably strong against a known plaintext attack (up to a plausible conjecture). Both state transition function and output function could be key-dependent, so the only information available to a cryptanalyst is that these functions belong to some (exponentially large) class. These functions are compositions of standard machine instructions (such as addition, multiplication, bitwise logical operations, etc.) The compositions should satisfy rather loose conditions; so the corresponding generators are flexible enough and could be easily implemented as computer programs.",Cryptography and Security

The cryptographical strength of the proposed stream cipher is based on the fact that breaking it would be at least as hard as solving systems of multivariate polynomial equations modulo big prime number $p$ which is NP-hard problem and there are no known fast randomized or deterministic algorithms for solving it. Unlikely the speed of known ciphers that work in $\bbbz_p^*$ for big prime numbers $p$, the speed of this stream cipher both in encryption and decryption phase is comparable with the fastest symmetric-key stream ciphers.",Cryptography and Security

This chapter presents a soft computing approach to detect intrusions in a network. Among the several soft computing paradigms, we investigated fuzzy rule-based classifiers, decision trees, support vector machines, linear genetic programming and an ensemble method to model fast and efficient intrusion detection systems.

Then these parts are packaged into packets and sent to the receiver. A secure and efficient mechanism is provided to convey the information that is necessary for obtaining the original data at the receiver-end from its parts in the packets, that is, for solving the 'jigsaw puzzle'. The algorithm is designed to provide information-theoretic (that is, unconditional) security by the use of a one-time pad like scheme so that no intermediate or unintended node can obtain the entire data. An authentication code is also used to ensure authenticity of every packet.",Cryptography and Security

  New Methodologies of Anonymization","Logs are one of the most fundamental resources to any security professional. It is widely recognized by the government and industry that it is both beneficial and desirable to share logs for the purpose of security research. However, the sharing is not happening or not to the degree or magnitude that is desired. Organizations are reluctant to share logs because of the risk of exposing sensitive information to potential attackers. We believe this reluctance remains high because current anonymization techniques are weak and one-size-fits-all--or better put, one size tries to fit all. We must develop standards and make anonymization available at varying levels, striking a balance between privacy and utility. Organizations have different needs and trust other organizations to different degrees. They must be able to map multiple anonymization levels with defined risks to the trust levels they share with (would-be) receivers. It is not until there are industry standards for multiple levels of anonymization that we will be able to move forward and achieve the goal of widespread sharing of logs for security researchers.",Cryptography and Security

Like other similar schemes it is successfully attacked by criminals. After shortly classifying the various kinds of attacks we accomplish malicious code attacks on real World Wide Web transaction systems. In doing so we find that it is really easy to outflank these systems. This is even supported by the users' behavior. We give a few simple behavior rules to improve this situation.

In this paper we study a public key cryptosystem based on such polynomials, which provides both encryption and digital signature. The cryptosystem works on real numbers and is quite efficient. Unfortunately, from our analysis it comes up that it is not secure. We describe an attack which permits to recover the corresponding plaintext from a given ciphertext. The same attack can be applied to produce forgeries if the cryptosystem is used for signing messages. Then, we point out that also other primitives, a Diffie-Hellman like key agreement scheme and an authentication scheme, designed along the same lines of the cryptosystem, are not secure due to the aforementioned attack.

We propose a security abstraction, inspired by earlier work on secure RPC, in which the methods exported by a web service are annotated with one of three security levels: none, authenticated, or both authenticated and encrypted. We model our abstraction as an object calculus with primitives for defining and calling web services. We describe the semantics of our object calculus by translating to a lower-level language with primitives for message passing and cryptography. To validate our semantics, we embed correspondence assertions that specify the correct authentication of requests and responses. By appeal to the type theory for cryptographic protocols of Gordon and Jeffrey's Cryptyc, we verify the correspondence assertions simply by typing.

This inevitable architectural choice renders the simulation vulnerable to attacks against the semantic integrity of the simulation: malicious clients may attempt to compromise the physical and logical laws governing the simulation, or to alter the causality of events a posteriori. In this paper, we initiate the systematic study of semantic integrity in NVEs from a security point of view. We argue that naive policies to enforce semantic integrity involve intolerable network load, and are therefore not practically feasible. We present a new semantic integrity protocol based on cryptographic primitives which enables the server system to audit the local computations of the clients on demand. Our approach facilitates low network and CPU load, incurs reasonable engineering overhead, and maximally decouples the auditing process from the soft real time constraints of the simulation.",Cryptography and Security
2179,Improving Spam Detection Based on Structural Similarity,"We propose a new detection algorithm that uses structural relationships between senders and recipients of email as the basis for the identification of spam messages. Users and receivers are represented as vectors in their reciprocal spaces. A measure of similarity between vectors is constructed and used to group users into clusters. Knowledge of their classification as past senders/receivers of spam or legitimate mail, comming from an auxiliary detection algorithm, is then used to label these clusters probabilistically. This knowledge comes from an auxiliary algorithm. The measure of similarity between the sender and receiver sets of a new message to the center vector of clusters is then used to asses the possibility of that message being legitimate or spam. We show that the proposed algorithm is able to correct part of the false positives (legitimate messages classified as spam) using a testbed of one week smtp log.",Cryptography and Security
2180,Efficient Authenticated Encryption Schemes with Public Verifiability,"An authenticated encryption scheme allows messages to be encrypted and authenticated simultaneously. In 2003, Ma and Chen proposed such a scheme with public verifiability. That is, in their scheme the receiver can efficiently prove to a third party that a message is indeed originated from a specific sender. In this paper, we first identify two security weaknesses in the Ma-Chen authenticated encryption scheme. Then, based on the Schnorr signature, we proposed an efficient and secure improved scheme such that all the desired security requirements are satisfied.",Cryptography and Security
2181,Analyzing Worms and Network Traffic using Compression,"Internet worms have become a widespread threat to system and network operations. In order to fight them more efficiently, it is necessary to analyze newly discovered worms and attack patterns. This paper shows how techniques based on Kolmogorov Complexity can help in the analysis of internet worms and network traffic. Using compression, different species of worms can be clustered by type. This allows us to determine whether an unknown worm binary could in fact be a later version of an existing worm in an extremely simple, automated, manner. This may become a useful tool in the initial analysis of malicious binaries. Furthermore, compression can also be useful to distinguish different types of network traffic and can thus help to detect traffic anomalies: Certain anomalies may be detected by looking at the compressibility of a network session alone. We furthermore show how to use compression to detect malicious network sessions that are very similar to known intrusion attempts. This technique could become a useful tool to detect new variations of an attack and thus help to prevent IDS evasion. We provide two new plugins for Snort which demonstrate both approaches.",Cryptography and Security

2184,On the Unicity Distance of Stego Key,"Steganography is about how to send secret message covertly. And the purpose of steganalysis is to not only detect the existence of the hidden message but also extract it. So far there have been many reliable detecting methods on various steganographic algorithms, while there are few approaches that can extract the hidden information. In this paper, the difficulty of extracting hidden information, which is essentially a kind of privacy, is analyzed with information-theoretic method in the terms of unicity distance of steganographic key (abbreviated stego key). A lower bound for the unicity distance is obtained, which shows the relations between key rate, message rate, hiding capacity and difficulty of extraction. Furthermore the extracting attack to steganography is viewed as a special kind of cryptanalysis, and an effective method on recovering the stego key of popular LSB replacing steganography in spatial images is presented by combining the detecting technique of steganalysis and correlation attack of cryptanalysis together. The analysis for this method and experimental results on steganographic software ``Hide and Seek 4.1"" are both accordant with the information-theoretic conclusion.",Cryptography and Security

2190,Steganographic Codes -- a New Problem of Coding Theory,"To study how to design steganographic algorithm more efficiently, a new coding problem -- steganographic codes (abbreviated stego-codes) -- is presented in this paper. The stego-codes are defined over the field with $q(q\ge2)$ elements. Firstly a method of constructing linear stego-codes is proposed by using the direct sum of vector subspaces. And then the problem of linear stego-codes is converted to an algebraic problem by introducing the concept of $t$th dimension of vector space. And some bounds on the length of stego-codes are obtained, from which the maximum length embeddable (MLE) code is brought up. It is shown that there is a corresponding relation between MLE codes and perfect error-correcting codes. Furthermore the classification of all MLE codes and a lower bound on the number of binary MLE codes are obtained based on the corresponding results on perfect codes. Finally hiding redundancy is defined to value the performance of stego-codes.",Cryptography and Security

The oldest and the simplest methods are more concentrated on integrity of the code itself and on the detection of unauthorized manipulation. Other, more advanced proposals protect not only the code but also the execution state and the collected data. The paper is divided into two parts.

Since then, it has been believed that the perfectly random and uncompressible OTP which is transmitted needs to have a length equal to the message length for this result to be true. In this paper, we prove that the length of the transmitted OTP which actually contains useful information need not be compromised and could be less than the message length without sacrificing perfect secrecy. We also provide a new interpretation for the OTP encryption by treating the message bits as making True/False statements about the pad, which we define as a private-object. We introduce the paradigm of private-object cryptography where messages are transmitted by verifying statements about a secret-object. We conclude by suggesting the use of Formal Axiomatic Systems for investing N bits of secret.",Cryptography and Security

This taxonomy is grounded in a theoretical model of computing, which establishes the relationship between vulnerabilities, software applications and the computer system resources. This relationship illustrates that a software application is exploited by violating constraints imposed by computer system resources and assumptions made about their usage. In other words, a vulnerability exists in the software application if it allows violation of these constraints and assumptions. The taxonomy classifies these constraints and assumptions. The model also serves as a basis for the classification scheme the taxonomy uses, in which the computer system resources such as, memory, input/output, and cryptographic resources serve as categories and subcategories. Vulnerabilities, which are expressed in the form of constraints and assumptions, are classified according to these categories and subcategories.

Some of these assumptions, like having a ""secure"" chan- nel to transmit data, or having sound algorithms to check the correct- ness of the data, are not addressed by this paper. We will focus on two simple issues: the problem of using adequate passwords and the problem of managing passwords.   The proposed solution, the pathword, is a method that guarantees:   1 that the passwords generated with the help of a pathword are adequate (i.e. that they are not easy to guess),   2 that managing pathwords is more user friendly than managing passwords and that pathwords are less amenable to problems typical of passwords.",Cryptography and Security

Moreover, both the state update function and the output function are being modified dynamically during the encryption. Also, these compositions could be keyed, so the only information available to an attacker is that these functions belong to some exponentially large class.   The paper shows that under rather loose conditions the output sequence is uniformly distributed, achieves maximum period length and has high linear complexity and high $\ell$-error linear complexity. Ciphers of this kind are flexible: One could choose a suitable combination of instructions to obtain due performance without affecting the quality of the output sequence.

2230,Access Control for Hierarchical Joint-Tenancy,"Basic role based access control [RBAC] provides a mechanism for segregating access privileges based upon a user's hierarchical roles within an organization. This model doesn't scale well when there is tight integration of multiple hierarchies. In a case where there is joint-tenancy and a requirement for different levels of disclosure based upon a user's hierarchy, or in our case, organization or company, basic RBAC requires these hierarchies to be effectively merged. Specific roles that effectively represent both the user's organizations and roles must be translated to fit within the merged hierarchy to be used to control access. Essentially, users from multiple organizations are served from a single role base with roles designed to constrain their access as needed.   Our work proposes, through parameterized roles and privileges, a means for accurately representing both users' roles within their respective hierarchies for providing access to controlled objects. Using this method will reduce the amount of complexity required in terms of the number of roles and privileges. The resulting set of roles, privileges, and objects will make modeling and visualizing the access role hierarchy significantly simplified. This paper will give some background on role based access control, parameterized roles and privileges, and then focus on how RBAC with parameterized roles and privileges can be leveraged as an access control solution for the problems presented by joint tenancy.",Cryptography and Security

  Encryption","Although good encryption functions are probabilistic, most symbolic models do not capture this aspect explicitly. A typical solution, recently used to prove the soundness of such models with respect to computational ones, is to explicitly represent the dependency of ciphertexts on random coins as labels. In order to make these label-based models useful, it seems natural to try to extend the underlying decision procedures and the implementation of existing tools. In this paper we put forth a more practical alternative based on the following soundness theorem. We prove that for a large class of security properties (that includes rather standard formulations for secrecy and authenticity properties), security of protocols in the simpler model implies security in the label-based model. Combined with the soundness result of (\textbf{?}) our theorem enables the translation of security results in unlabeled symbolic models to computational security.",Cryptography and Security

Moreover, the proposed steganographic system has two important properties. First, the rate of transmission of hidden information approaches the Shannon entropy of the covertext source as the size of blocks used for hidden text encoding tends to infinity. Second, if the size of the alphabet of the covertext source and its minentropy tend to infinity then the number of bits of hidden text per letter of covertext tends to $\log(n!)/n$ where $n$ is the (fixed) size of blocks used for hidden text encoding.

We seek to address this systemic problem.   In previous work we developed a unified correlated logging system (UCLog) that automatically processes alerts from different devices. We take this work one step further by presenting the architecture and applications of UCLog+ which adds the new capability to correlate between alerts and incidents and raw data located on remote logs. UCLog+ can be used for forensic analysis including queries and report generation but more importantly it can be used for near-real-time situational awareness of attack patterns in progress.

2252,Tardos fingerprinting is better than we thought,"We review the fingerprinting scheme by Tardos and show that it has a much better performance than suggested by the proofs in Tardos' original paper. In particular, the length of the codewords can be significantly reduced.   First we generalize the proofs of the false positive and false negative error probabilities with the following modifications: (1) we replace Tardos' hard-coded numbers by variables and (2) we allow for independently chosen false positive and false negative error rates. It turns out that all the collusion-resistance properties can still be proven when the code length is reduced by a factor of more than 2.   Second, we study the statistical properties of the fingerprinting scheme, in particular the average and variance of the accusations. We identify which colluder strategy forces the content owner to employ the longest code. Using a gaussian approximation for the probability density functions of the accusations, we show that the required false negative and false positive error rate can be achieved with codes that are a factor 2 shorter than required for rigid proofs.   Combining the results of these two approaches, we show that the Tardos scheme can be used with a code length approximately 5 times shorter than in the original construction.",Cryptography and Security

We also prove that the set of security properties expressed with SIFs is not closed under conjunction, from which it follows that separability is strictly stronger than double generalized noninterference. However, we show that if we generalize the notion of SIF in a natural way, then NOS is expressible, and the set of security properties expressible by generalized SIFs is closed under conjunction.",Cryptography and Security
2255,Secure Positioning of Mobile Terminals with Simplex Radio Communication,"With the rapid spread of various mobile terminals in our society, the importance of secure positioning is growing for wireless networks in adversarial settings. Recently, several authors have proposed a secure positioning mechanism of mobile terminals which is based on the geometric property of wireless node placement, and on the postulate of modern physics that a propagation speed of information never exceeds the velocity of light. In particular, they utilize the measurements of the round-trip time of radio signal propagation and bidirectional communication for variants of the challenge-and-response. In this paper, we propose a novel means to construct the above mechanism by use of unidirectional communication instead of bidirectional communication. Our proposal is based on the assumption that a mobile terminal incorporates a high-precision inner clock in a tamper-resistant protected area. In positioning, the mobile terminal uses its inner clock and the time and location information broadcasted by radio from trusted stations. Our proposal has a major advantage in protecting the location privacy of mobile terminal users, because the mobile terminal need not provide any information to the trusted stations through positioning procedures. Besides, our proposal is free from the positioning error due to claimant's processing-time fluctuations in the challenge-and-response, and is well-suited for mobile terminals in the open air, or on the move at high speed, in terms of practical usage. We analyze the security, the functionality, and the feasibility of our proposal in comparison to previous proposals.",Cryptography and Security

We study one important type of E-Commerce transaction website, E-Tax Filing, that is exposed to large populations. We assess a large number of international (5), Federal (USA), and state E-Tax filing websites (38) for both technical security protection and human perception of security.

Some general properties of the parameters have been studied in [12,[9] and [13]. The MDS secret-sharing scheme was defined in [12] and it is proved that MDS perfect secret sharing scheme can be constructed for any monotone access structure. The famous Shamir $(k,n)$ threshold secret sharing scheme is the MDS with $d_{min}=d_{cheat}=n-k+1$. In [3] we proposed the linear secret sharing scheme from algebraic-geometric codes.

2258,Oblivious-Transfer Amplification,"Oblivious transfer is a primitive of paramount importance in cryptography or, more precisely, two- and multi-party computation due to its universality. Unfortunately, oblivious transfer cannot be achieved in an unconditionally secure way for both parties from scratch. Therefore, it is a natural question what information-theoretic primitives or computational assumptions oblivious transfer can be based on.   The results in our thesis are threefold. First, we present a protocol that implements oblivious transfer from a weakened oblivious transfer called universal oblivious transfer, where one of the two players may get additional information. Our reduction is about twice as efficient as previous results.   Weak oblivious transfer is an even weaker form of oblivious transfer, where both players may obtain additional information about the other player's input, and where the output can contain errors. We give a new, weaker definition of weak oblivious transfer, as well as new reductions with a more detailed analysis.   Finally, we carry over our results to the computational setting and show how a weak oblivious transfer that is sometimes incorrect and only mildly secure against computationally bounded adversaries can be strengthened.",Cryptography and Security

High algebraic immunity is a necessary condition for resisting algebraic attacks. In this paper, we give some lower bounds on algebraic immunity of Boolean functions.

  Public-Key Model","We consider a type of zero-knowledge protocols that are of interest for their practical applications within networks like the Internet: efficient zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge that remain secure against concurrent man-in-the-middle attacks. In an effort to reduce the setup assumptions required for efficient zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge that remain secure against concurrent man-in-the-middle attacks, we consider a model, which we call the Authenticated Public-Key (APK) model. The APK model seems to significantly reduce the setup assumptions made by the CRS model (as no trusted party or honest execution of a centralized algorithm are required), and can be seen as a slightly stronger variation of the Bare Public-Key (BPK) model from \cite{CGGM,MR}, and a weaker variation of the registered public-key model used in \cite{BCNP}. We then define and study man-in-the-middle attacks in the APK model. Our main result is a constant-round concurrent non-malleable zero-knowledge argument of knowledge for any polynomial-time relation (associated to a language in $\mathcal{NP}$), under the (minimal) assumption of the existence of a one-way function family. Furthermore,We show time-efficient instantiations of our protocol based on known number-theoretic assumptions. We also note a negative result with respect to further reducing the setup assumptions of our protocol to those in the (unauthenticated) BPK model, by showing that concurrently non-malleable zero-knowledge arguments of knowledge in the BPK model are only possible for trivial languages.",Cryptography and Security

We show how to solve the problem privately with comparable cost, in the sense that nothing is learned by Alice and Bob beyond what is implied by their input, the ideal top-B output, and goodness of approximation (equivalently, the Euclidean norm of the vector sum).

Our optimizations drastically reduce the number of non-deterministic choices, in particular those for variable identification and linear orderings. This is important for reducing both the runtime of the unification algorithm and the number of unifiers in the complete set of unifiers.

Attackers can break the encryption by measuring the energy consumed in the working digital circuit. To prevent this type of attack, this paper proposes the use of reversible logic for designing the ALU of a cryptosystem. Ideally, reversible circuits dissipate zero energy. Thus, it would be of great significance to apply reversible logic to designing secure cryptosystems. As far as is known, this is the first attempt to apply reversible logic to developing secure cryptosystems. In a prototype of a reversible ALU for a crypto-processor, reversible designs of adders and Montgomery multipliers are presented. The reversible designs of a carry propagate adder, four-to-two and five-to-two carry save adders are presented using a reversible TSG gate. One of the important properties of the TSG gate is that it can work singly as a reversible full adder. In order to design the reversible Montgomery multiplier, novel reversible sequential circuits are also proposed which are integrated with the proposed adders to design a reversible modulo multiplier. It is intended that this paper will provide a starting point for developing cryptosystems secure against DPA attacks.",Cryptography and Security

Our approach is to verify properties of component protocols in a multi-protocol environment, then deduce properties about the composed protocol. To reduce the complexity of multi-protocol verification, we introduce a notion of protocol independence and prove a number of theorems that enable analysis of independent component protocols in isolation.

We have verified our reconstruction result correctness by simulating the overview of Lili-128 keystream generators using our getting fd and implement designers reference module of the Lili-128 stream cipher, and two methods produce the same synchronous keystream sequence on same initial state, so that our research work proves that the nonlinear filter function of LILI-128 stream cipher is successfully reconstructed.",Cryptography and Security

Our IBE scheme enjoys the same \textsf{Key Extraction} and \textsf{Decryption} algorithms with the famous IBE scheme of Boneh and Franklin (BF-IBE for short), while differs from the latter in that it has modified \textsf{Setup} and \textsf{Encryption} algorithms.   Compared with BF-IBE, we show that ours are more practical in a multiple private key generator (PKG) environment, mainly due to that the session secret $g_{ID}$ could be pre-computed \emph{before} any interaction, and the sender could encrypt a message using $g_{ID}$ prior to negotiating with the intended recipient(s). As an application of our IBE scheme, we also derive an escrowed ElGamal scheme which possesses certain good properties in practice.",Cryptography and Security
2290,How to Guarantee Secrecy for Cryptographic Protocols,"In this paper we propose a general definition of secrecy for cryptographic protocols in the Dolev-Yao model. We give a sufficient condition ensuring secrecy for protocols where rules have encryption depth at most two, that is satisfied by almost all practical protocols. The only allowed primitives in the class of protocols we consider are pairing and encryption with atomic keys. Moreover, we describe an algorithm of practical interest which transforms a cryptographic protocol into a secure one from the point of view of secrecy, without changing its original goal with respect to secrecy of nonces and keys, provided the protocol satisfies some conditions. These conditions are not very restrictive and are satisfied for most practical protocols.",Cryptography and Security

Illuminate through an analysis and ex.3 that there is a logic error during deduction of fact 1.2, which causes each of fact 1.2, 1.3, 4 to be invalid. Demonstrate through ex.4 and 5 that each or the combination of qu+1 > qu * D at fact 4 and table 1 at fact 2.2 is not sufficient for f(i) + f(j) = f(k), property 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 each are invalid, and alg.1 based on fact 4 and alg.2 based on table 1 are disordered and wrong logically. Further, manifest through a repeated experiment and ex.5 that the data at table 2 is falsified, and the example in [8] is woven elaborately. We explain why Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is changed to Cx = (Ax * W^f(x))^d (% M) in REESSE1+ v2.1. To the signature fraud, we point out that [8] misunderstands the existence of T^-1 and Q^-1 % (M-1), and forging of Q can be easily avoided through moving H. Therefore, the conclusion of [8] that REESSE1+ is not secure at all (which connotes that [8] can extract a related private key from any public key in REESSE1+) is fully incorrect, and as long as the parameter Omega is fitly selected, REESSE1+ with Cx = Ax * W^f(x) (% M) is secure.",Cryptography and Security

2293,Using Image Attributes for Human Identification Protocols,"A secure human identification protocol aims at authenticating human users to a remote server when even the users' inputs are not hidden from an adversary. Recently, the authors proposed a human identification protocol in the RSA Conference 2007, which is loosely based on the ability of humans to efficiently process an image. The advantage being that an automated adversary is not effective in attacking the protocol without human assistance. This paper extends that work by trying to solve some of the open problems. First, we analyze the complexity of defeating the proposed protocols by quantifying the workload of a human adversary. Secondly, we propose a new construction based on textual CAPTCHAs (Reverse Turing Tests) in order to make the generation of automated challenges easier. We also present a brief experiment involving real human users to find out the number of possible attributes in a given image and give some guidelines for the selection of challenge questions based on the results. Finally, we analyze the previously proposed protocol in detail for the relationship between the secrets. Our results show that we can construct human identification protocols based on image evaluation with reasonably ``quantified'' security guarantees based on our model.",Cryptography and Security

Hence special solutions are needed for specific problems for efficiency reasons.

2299,Probabilistic Anonymity and Admissible Schedulers,"When studying safety properties of (formal) protocol models, it is customary to view the scheduler as an adversary: an entity trying to falsify the safety property. We show that in the context of security protocols, and in particular of anonymizing protocols, this gives the adversary too much power; for instance, the contents of encrypted messages and internal computations by the parties should be considered invisible to the adversary.   We restrict the class of schedulers to a class of admissible schedulers which better model adversarial behaviour. These admissible schedulers base their decision solely on the past behaviour of the system that is visible to the adversary.   Using this, we propose a definition of anonymity: for all admissible schedulers the identity of the users and the observations of the adversary are independent stochastic variables. We also develop a proof technique for typical cases that can be used to proof anonymity: a system is anonymous if it is possible to `exchange' the behaviour of two users without the adversary `noticing'.",Cryptography and Security

We give algorithms for the problem (we call the MSCSPv) on which the security of the AAGL protocol is based upon. Hence we give various attacks for general parameters on the recent AAGL protocol proposed. One of our attacks is a deterministic algorithm which has space complexity and time complexity both atleast exponentialin the worst case. In a better case using a probabilistic algorithm the time complexity canbe O(|XSS(ui')^L5*(n^(1+e)) and the space complexity can be O(|XSS(ui')|^L6), where the element ui' is part of a public key, n is the index of braid group, XSS is a summit type set and e is a constant in a limit. The above shows the AAGL protocol is potentially not significantly more secure as using key agreement protocols based on the conjugacy problem such as the AAG (Anshel-Anshel-Goldfeld) protocol because both protocols can be broken with complexity which do not significantly differ.

To address this issue, logic gates that have a constant power dissipation independent of the input signals, are used in security ICs. This paper presents a design methodology to create fully connected differential pull down networks. Fully connected differential pull down networks are transistor networks that for any complementary input combination connect all the internal nodes of the network to one of the external nodes of the network. They are memoryless and for that reason have a constant load capacitance and power consumption. This type of networks is used in specialized logic gates to guarantee a constant contribution of the internal nodes into the total power consumption of the logic gate.",Cryptography and Security

  Algorithm (MHHEA) for Data Communication Security","The hybrid hiding encryption algorithm, as its name implies, embraces concepts from both steganography and cryptography. In this exertion, an improved micro-architecture Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation of this algorithm is presented. This design overcomes the observed limitations of a previously-designed micro-architecture. These observed limitations are: no exploitation of the possibility of parallel bit replacement, and the fact that the input plaintext was encrypted serially, which caused a dependency between the throughput and the nature of the used secret key. This dependency can be viewed by some as vulnerability in the security of the implemented micro-architecture. The proposed modified micro-architecture is constructed using five basic modules. These modules are; the message cache, the message alignment module, the key cache, the comparator, and at last the encryption module. In this work, we provide comprehensive simulation and implementation results. These are: the timing diagrams, the post-implementation timing and routing reports, and finally the floor plan.

  Iteratively Applying Karatsuba's Method","Securing communication channels is especially needed in wireless environments. But applying cipher mechanisms in software is limited by the calculation and energy resources of the mobile devices. If hardware is applied to realize cryptographic operations cost becomes an issue. In this paper we describe an approach which tackles all these three points. We implemented a hardware accelerator for polynomial multiplication in extended Galois fields (GF) applying Karatsuba's method iteratively. With this approach the area consumption is reduced to 2.1 mm^2 in comparison to. 6.2 mm^2 for the standard application of Karatsuba's method i.e. for recursive application. Our approach also reduces the energy consumption to 60 per cent of the original approach. The price we have to pay for these achievement is the increased execution time. In our implementation a polynomial multiplication takes 3 clock cycles whereas the recurisve Karatsuba approach needs only one clock cycle. But considering area, energy and calculation speed we are convinced that the benefits of our approach outweigh its drawback.",Cryptography and Security

Following a general description of the standard, the paper contains a detailed analysis of the cryptographic operations that have to be carried out before protected content can be accessed. The combination of this analysis with data on execution times for specific algorithms realized in hardware and software has made it possible to build a model which has allowed us to assert that hardware acceleration for specific cryptographic algorithms can significantly reduce the impact DRM has on a mobile terminal's processing performance and battery life.",Cryptography and Security

[4] introduced a lower bound for the best pixel expansion of this scheme in terms of minimal qualified sets. We present another lower bound for the best pixel expansion of the scheme. As a corollary, we introduce a lower bound, based on an induced matching of hypergraph of qualified sets, for the best pixel expansion of the aforementioned model and the traditional model of visual cryptography realized by basis matrices. Finally, we study access structures based on graphs and we present an upper bound for the smallest pixel expansion in terms of strong chromatic index.",Cryptography and Security
2319,Fuzzy Private Matching (Extended Abstract),"In the private matching problem, a client and a server each hold a set of $n$ input elements. The client wants to privately compute the intersection of these two sets: he learns which elements he has in common with the server (and nothing more), while the server gains no information at all. In certain applications it would be useful to have a private matching protocol that reports a match even if two elements are only similar instead of equal. Such a private matching protocol is called \emph{fuzzy}, and is useful, for instance, when elements may be inaccurate or corrupted by errors.   We consider the fuzzy private matching problem, in a semi-honest environment. Elements are similar if they match on $t$ out of $T$ attributes. First we show that the original solution proposed by Freedman et al. is incorrect. Subsequently we present two fuzzy private matching protocols. The first, simple, protocol has bit message complexity $O(n \binom{T}{t} (T \log{|D|}+k))$. The second, improved, protocol has a much better bit message complexity of $O(n T (\log{|D|}+k))$, but here the client incurs a O(n) factor time complexity.

Combining these two properties we can produce unilateral one-way function and provide a case of utilizing this function to construct encryption algorithm. The multiple-precision (MP) library is used to analyze nonlinear dynamics systems and achieve the code. As an example, we provide a scheme of encrypting a plaintext by employing the one-way function with Lorenz system.

There are many anonymization techniques, and there are many ways to anonymize a particular log (that is, which fields to anonymize and how). Different anonymization policies will result in logs with varying levels of utility for analysis. In this paper we explore the effect of different anonymization policies on logs.

2343,Distributed Double Spending Prevention,"We study the problem of preventing double spending in electronic payment schemes in a distributed fashion. This problem occurs, for instance, when the spending of electronic coins needs to be controlled by a large collection of nodes (eg. in a peer-to-peer (P2P) system) instead of one central bank. Contrary to the commonly held belief that this is fundamentally impossible, we propose several solutions that do achieve a reasonable level of double spending prevention, and analyse their efficiency under varying assumptions.",Cryptography and Security
2344,The Ephemeral Pairing Problem,"In wireless ad-hoc broadcast networks the pairing problem consists of establishing a (long-term) connection between two specific physical nodes in the network that do not yet know each other. We focus on the ephemeral version of this problem. Ephemeral pairings occur, for example, when electronic business cards are exchanged between two people that meet, or when one pays at a check-out using a wireless wallet.   This problem can, in more abstract terms, be phrased as an ephemeral key exchange problem: given a low bandwidth authentic (or private) communication channel between two nodes, and a high bandwidth broadcast channel, can we establish a high-entropy shared secret session key between the two nodes without relying on any a priori shared secret information.   Apart from introducing this new problem, we present several ephemeral key exchange protocols, both for the case of authentic channels as well as for the case of private channels.",Cryptography and Security
2345,"New Extensions of Pairing-based Signatures into Universal (Multi)
  Designated Verifier Signatures","The concept of universal designated verifier signatures was introduced by Steinfeld, Bull, Wang and Pieprzyk at Asiacrypt 2003. These signatures can be used as standard publicly verifiable digital signatures but have an additional functionality which allows any holder of a signature to designate the signature to any desired verifier. This designated verifier can check that the message was indeed signed, but is unable to convince anyone else of this fact. We propose new efficient constructions for pairing-based short signatures. Our first scheme is based on Boneh-Boyen signatures and its security can be analyzed in the standard security model. We prove its resistance to forgery assuming the hardness of the so-called strong Diffie-Hellman problem, under the knowledge-of-exponent assumption. The second scheme is compatible with the Boneh-Lynn-Shacham signatures and is proven unforgeable, in the random oracle model, under the assumption that the computational bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem is untractable. Both schemes are designed for devices with constrained computation capabilities since the signing and the designation procedure are pairing-free. Finally, we present extensions of these schemes in the multi-user setting proposed by Desmedt in 2003.",Cryptography and Security
2346,Multi-Use Unidirectional Proxy Re-Signatures,"In 1998, Blaze, Bleumer, and Strauss suggested a cryptographic primitive named proxy re-signatures where a proxy turns a signature computed under Alice's secret key into one from Bob on the same message. The semi-trusted proxy does not learn either party's signing key and cannot sign arbitrary messages on behalf of Alice or Bob. At CCS 2005, Ateniese and Hohenberger revisited the primitive by providing appropriate security definitions and efficient constructions in the random oracle model. Nonetheless, they left open the problem of designing a multi-use unidirectional scheme where the proxy is able to translate in only one direction and signatures can be re-translated several times.   This paper solves this problem, suggested for the first time 10 years ago, and shows the first multi-hop unidirectional proxy re-signature schemes. We describe a random-oracle-using system that is secure in the Ateniese-Hohenberger model. The same technique also yields a similar construction in the standard model (i.e. without relying on random oracles). Both schemes are efficient and require newly defined -- but falsifiable -- Diffie-Hellman-like assumptions in bilinear groups.",Cryptography and Security

2352,"Hierarchical Grid-Based Pairwise Key Pre-distribution in Wireless Sensor
  Networks","The security of wireless sensor networks is an active topic of research where both symmetric and asymmetric key cryptography issues have been studied. Due to their computational feasibility on typical sensor nodes, symmetric key algorithms that use the same key to encrypt and decrypt messages have been intensively studied and perfectly deployed in such environment. Because of the wireless sensor's limited infrastructure, the bottleneck challenge for deploying these algorithms is the key distribution. For the same reason of resources restriction, key distribution mechanisms which are used in traditional wireless networks are not efficient for sensor networks.   To overcome the key distribution problem, several key pre-distribution algorithms and techniques that assign keys or keying material for the networks nodes in an offline phase have been introduced recently. In this paper, we introduce a supplemental distribution technique based on the communication pattern and deployment knowledge modeling. Our technique is based on the hierarchical grid deployment. For granting a proportional security level with number of dependent sensors, we use different polynomials in different orders with different weights. In seek of our proposed work's value, we provide a detailed analysis on the used resources, resulting security, resiliency, and connectivity compared with other related works.",Cryptography and Security

  Infrastructures","In discrete logarithm based cryptography, a method by Pohlig and Hellman allows solving the discrete logarithm problem efficiently if the group order is known and has no large prime factors. The consequence is that such groups are avoided. In the past, there have been proposals for cryptography based on cyclic infrastructures. We will show that the Pohlig-Hellman method can be adapted to certain cyclic infrastructures, which similarly implies that certain infrastructures should not be used for cryptography. This generalizes a result by M\""uller, Vanstone and Zuccherato for infrastructures obtained from hyperelliptic function fields.   We recall the Pohlig-Hellman method, define the concept of a cyclic infrastructure and briefly describe how to obtain such infrastructures from certain function fields of unit rank one. Then, we describe how to obtain cyclic groups from discrete cyclic infrastructures and how to apply the Pohlig-Hellman method to compute absolute distances, which is in general a computationally hard problem for cyclic infrastructures. Moreover, we give an algorithm which allows to test whether an infrastructure satisfies certain requirements needed for applying the Pohlig-Hellman method, and discuss whether the Pohlig-Hellman method is applicable in infrastructures obtained from number fields. Finally, we discuss how this influences cryptography based on cyclic infrastructures.",Cryptography and Security

Its design and implementation details are kept secret by its manufacturer. This paper studies the architecture of the card and the communication protocol between card and reader. Then it gives a practical, low-cost, attack that recovers secret information from the memory of the card. Due to a weakness in the pseudo-random generator, we are able to recover the keystream generated by the CRYPTO1 stream cipher. We exploit the malleability of the stream cipher to read all memory blocks of the first sector of the card. Moreover, we are able to read any sector of the memory of the card, provided that we know one memory block within this sector.

We extend the original definition of a handshaking protocol to allow and test for membership of multiple groups simultaneously.

2358,Securing U-Healthcare Sensor Networks using Public Key Based Scheme,"Recent emergence of electronic culture uplifts healthcare facilities to a new era with the aid of wireless sensor network (WSN) technology. Due to the sensitiveness of medical data, austere privacy and security are inevitable for all parts of healthcare systems. However, the constantly evolving nature and constrained resources of sensors in WSN inflict unavailability of a lucid line of defense to ensure perfect security. In order to provide holistic security, protections must be incorporated in every component of healthcare sensor networks. This paper proposes an efficient security scheme for healthcare applications of WSN which uses the notion of public key cryptosystem. Our entire security scheme comprises basically of two parts; a key handshaking scheme based on simple linear operations and the derivation of decryption key by a receiver node for a particular sender in the network. Our architecture allows both base station to node or node to base station secure communications, and node-to-node secure communications.

2362,Secure Remote Voting Using Paper Ballots,"Internet voting will probably be one of the most significant achievements of the future information society. It will have an enormous impact on the election process making it fast, reliable and inexpensive. Nonetheless, so far remote voting is considered to be very difficult, as one has to take into account susceptibility of the voter's PC to various cyber-attacks. As a result, most the research effort is put into developing protocols and machines for poll-site electronic voting. Although these solutions yield promising results, they cannot be directly adopted to Internet voting because of secure platform problem. However, the cryptographic components they utilize may be very useful. This paper presents a scheme based on combination of mixnets and homomorphic encryption borrowed from robust poll-site voting, along with techniques recommended for remote voting -- code sheets and test ballots. The protocol tries to minimize the trust put in voter's PC by making the voter responsible for manual encryption of his vote. To achieve this, the voter obtains a paper ballot that allows him to scramble the vote by performing simple operations (lookup in a table). Creation of paper ballots, as well as decryption of votes, is performed by a group of cooperating trusted servers. As a result, the scheme is characterized by strong asymmetry -- all computations are carried out on the server side. In consequence it does not require any additional hardware on the voter's side, and offers distributed trust, receipt-freeness and verifiability.",Cryptography and Security

2367,On White-box Cryptography and Obfuscation,"We study the relationship between obfuscation and white-box cryptography. We capture the requirements of any white-box primitive using a \emph{White-Box Property (WBP)} and give some negative/positive results. Loosely speaking, the WBP is defined for some scheme and a security notion (we call the pair a \emph{specification}), and implies that w.r.t. the specification, an obfuscation does not leak any ``useful'' information, even though it may leak some ``useless'' non-black-box information.   Our main result is a negative one - for most interesting programs, an obfuscation (under \emph{any} definition) cannot satisfy the WBP for every specification in which the program may be present. To do this, we define a \emph{Universal White-Box Property (UWBP)}, which if satisfied, would imply that under \emph{whatever} specification we conceive, the WBP is satisfied. We then show that for every non-approximately-learnable family, there exist (contrived) specifications for which the WBP (and thus, the UWBP) fails.   On the positive side, we show that there exists an obfuscator for a non-approximately-learnable family that achieves the WBP for a certain specification. Furthermore, there exists an obfuscator for a non-learnable (but approximately-learnable) family that achieves the UWBP.   Our results can also be viewed as formalizing the distinction between ``useful'' and ``useless'' non-black-box information.",Cryptography and Security

Such scheme enables an original signer to delegate the signature authority to a group of 'n' proxy signers with the condition that 't' or more proxy signers can cooperatively sign messages on behalf of the original signer and the signatures can only be verified by any two designated verifiers and that they cannot convince anyone else of this fact.,Cryptography and Security

  predistribution","The dynamic establishment of shared information (e.g. secret key) between two entities is particularly important in networks with no pre-determined structure such as wireless sensor networks (and in general wireless mobile ad-hoc networks). In such networks, nodes establish and terminate communication sessions dynamically with other nodes which may have never been encountered before, in order to somehow exchange information which will enable them to subsequently communicate in a secure manner. In this paper we give and theoretically analyze a series of protocols that enables two entities that have never encountered each other before to establish a shared piece of information for use as a key in setting up a secure communication session with the aid of a shared key encryption algorithm. These protocols do not require previous pre-distribution of candidate keys or some other piece of information of specialized form except a small seed value, from which the two entities can produce arbitrarily long strings with many similarities.",Cryptography and Security
2372,Information-Theoretically Secure Voting Without an Honest Majority,"We present three voting protocols with unconditional privacy and information-theoretic correctness, without assuming any bound on the number of corrupt voters or voting authorities. All protocols have polynomial complexity and require private channels and a simultaneous broadcast channel. Our first protocol is a basic voting scheme which allows voters to interact in order to compute the tally. Privacy of the ballot is unconditional, but any voter can cause the protocol to fail, in which case information about the tally may nevertheless transpire. Our second protocol introduces voting authorities which allow the implementation of the first protocol, while reducing the interaction and limiting it to be only between voters and authorities and among the authorities themselves. The simultaneous broadcast is also limited to the authorities. As long as a single authority is honest, the privacy is unconditional, however, a single corrupt authority or a single corrupt voter can cause the protocol to fail. Our final protocol provides a safeguard against corrupt voters by enabling a verification technique to allow the authorities to revoke incorrect votes. We also discuss the implementation of a simultaneous broadcast channel with the use of temporary computational assumptions, yielding versions of our protocols achieving everlasting security.",Cryptography and Security
2373,An Improved Robust Fuzzy Extractor,"We consider the problem of building robust fuzzy extractors, which allow two parties holding similar random variables W, W' to agree on a secret key R in the presence of an active adversary. Robust fuzzy extractors were defined by Dodis et al. in Crypto 2006 to be noninteractive, i.e., only one message P, which can be modified by an unbounded adversary, can pass from one party to the other. This allows them to be used by a single party at different points in time (e.g., for key recovery or biometric authentication), but also presents an additional challenge: what if R is used, and thus possibly observed by the adversary, before the adversary has a chance to modify P. Fuzzy extractors secure against such a strong attack are called post-application robust.   We construct a fuzzy extractor with post-application robustness that extracts a shared secret key of up to (2m-n)/2 bits (depending on error-tolerance and security parameters), where n is the bit-length and m is the entropy of W. The previously best known result, also of Dodis et al., extracted up to (2m-n)/3 bits (depending on the same parameters).",Cryptography and Security
2374,"Towards Black-Box Accountable Authority IBE with Short Ciphertexts and

In this model, if the Private Key Generator (PKG) maliciously re-distributes users' decryption keys, it runs the risk of being caught and prosecuted. Goyal proposed two constructions: the first one is efficient but can only trace well-formed decryption keys to their source; the second one allows tracing obfuscated decryption boxes in a model (called weak black-box model) where cheating authorities have no decryption oracle. The latter scheme is unfortunately far less efficient in terms of decryption cost and ciphertext size. In this work, we propose a new construction that combines the efficiency of Goyal's first proposal with a very simple weak black-box tracing mechanism. Our scheme is described in the selective-ID model but readily extends to meet all security properties in the adaptive-ID sense, which is not known to be true for prior black-box schemes.",Cryptography and Security

Our public key algorithm is a bijective mapping, it does not perform message expansions and can be used both for encryption and signatures. The public key consist of n quadratic polynomials with n variables where n=140, 160, ... . A particular characteristic of our public key algorithm is that it is very fast and highly parallelizable. More concretely, it has the speed of a typical modern symmetric block cipher - the reason for the phrase ""A Public Key Block Cipher"" in the title of this paper. Namely the reference C code for the 160-bit variant of the algorithm performs decryption in less than 11,000 cycles (on Intel Core 2 Duo -- using only one processor core), and around 6,000 cycles using two CPU cores and OpenMP 2.0 library.

2380,"Reducing Protocol Analysis with XOR to the XOR-free Case in the Horn
  Theory Based Approach","In the Horn theory based approach for cryptographic protocol analysis, cryptographic protocols and (Dolev-Yao) intruders are modeled by Horn theories and security analysis boils down to solving the derivation problem for Horn theories. This approach and the tools based on this approach, including ProVerif, have been very successful in the automatic analysis of cryptographic protocols w.r.t. an unbounded number of sessions. However, dealing with the algebraic properties of operators such as the exclusive OR (XOR) has been problematic. In particular, ProVerif cannot deal with XOR. In this paper, we show how to reduce the derivation problem for Horn theories with XOR to the XOR-free case. Our reduction works for an expressive class of Horn theories. A large class of intruder capabilities and protocols that employ the XOR operator can be modeled by these theories. Our reduction allows us to carry out protocol analysis by tools, such as ProVerif, that cannot deal with XOR, but are very efficient in the XOR-free case. We implemented our reduction and, in combination with ProVerif, applied it in the automatic analysis of several protocols that use the XOR operator.

2381,"Dynamics, robustness and fragility of trust","Trust is often conveyed through delegation, or through recommendation. This makes the trust authorities, who process and publish trust recommendations, into an attractive target for attacks and spoofing. In some recent empiric studies, this was shown to lead to a remarkable phenomenon of *adverse selection*: a greater percentage of unreliable or malicious web merchants were found among those with certain types of trust certificates, then among those without. While such findings can be attributed to a lack of diligence in trust authorities, or even to conflicts of interest, our analysis of trust dynamics suggests that public trust networks would probably remain vulnerable even if trust authorities were perfectly diligent. The reason is that the process of trust building, if trust is not breached too often, naturally leads to power-law distributions: the rich get richer, the trusted attract more trust. The evolutionary processes with such distributions, ubiquitous in nature, are known to be robust with respect to random failures, but vulnerable to adaptive attacks. We recommend some ways to decrease the vulnerability of trust building, and suggest some ideas for exploration.",Cryptography and Security

In this paper, we revise one of the recent PPDM schemes (i.e., FS) which is designed for privacy preserving association rule mining (PP-ARM). Our analysis shows some limitations of the FS scheme in term of its storage requirements guaranteeing a reasonable privacy standard and the high computation as well. On the other hand, we introduce a robust definition of privacy that considers the average case privacy and motivates the study of a weakness in the structure of FS (i.e., fake transactions filtering). In order to overcome this limit, we introduce a hybrid scheme that considers both privacy and resources guidelines. Experimental results show the efficiency of our proposed scheme over the previously introduced one and opens directions for further development.",Cryptography and Security

2386,A Fuzzy Commitment Scheme,"This paper attempt has been made to explain a fuzzy commitment scheme. In the conventional Commitment schemes, both committed string m and valid opening key are required to enable the sender to prove the commitment. However there could be many instances where the transmission involves noise or minor errors arising purely because of the factors over which neither the sender nor the receiver have any control. The fuzzy commitment scheme presented in this paper is to accept the opening key that is close to the original one in suitable distance metric, but not necessarily identical. The concept itself is illustrated with the help of simple situation.",Cryptography and Security
2387,A Tiered Security System for Mobile Devices,"We have designed a tiered security system for mobile devices where each security tier holds user-defined security triggers and actions. It has a friendly interface that allows users to easily define and configure the different circumstances and actions they need according to context. The system can be set up and activated from any browser or directly on the mobile device itself. When the security system is operated from a Web site or server, its configuration can be readily shared across multiple devices. When operated directly from the mobile device, no server is needed for activation. Many different types of security circumstances and actions can be set up and employed from its tiers. Security circumstances can range from temporary misplacement of a mobile device at home to malicious theft in a hostile region. Security actions can range from ringing a simple alarm to automatically erasing, overwriting, and re-erasing drives.",Cryptography and Security

There are two main categories of covert channels: timing channels and storage channels. This paper introduces a new storage channel technique called a protocol channel. A protocol channel switches one of at least two protocols to send a bit combination to a destination. The main goal of a protocol channel is that packets containing covert information look equal to all other packets within a network, what makes a protocol channel hard to detect.",Cryptography and Security
2389,"JDATATRANS for Array Obfuscation in Java Source Code to Defeat Reverse
  Engineering from Decompiled Codes","Software obfuscation or obscuring a software is an approach to defeat the practice of reverse engineering a software for using its functionality illegally in the development of another software. Java applications are more amenable to reverse engineering and re-engineering attacks through methods such as decompilation because Java class files store the program in a semi complied form called 'byte' codes. The existing obfuscation systems obfuscate the Java class files. Obfuscated source code produce obfuscated byte codes and hence two level obfuscation (source code and byte code level) of the program makes it more resilient to reverse engineering attacks. But source code obfuscation is much more difficult due to richer set of programming constructs and the scope of the different variables used in the program and only very little progress has been made on this front. Hence programmers resort to adhoc manual ways of obscuring their program which makes it difficult for its maintenance and usability. To address this issue partially, we developed a user friendly tool JDATATRANS to obfuscate Java source code by obscuring the array usages. Using various array restructuring techniques such as 'array splitting', 'array folding' and 'array flattening', in addition to constant hiding, our system obfuscate the input Java source code and produce an obfuscated Java source code that is functionally equivalent to the input program. We also perform a number of experiments to measure the potency, resilience and cost incurred by our tool.",Cryptography and Security

This paper presents a framework and methods to verify whether an implemented low-level security policy is compliant to a high-level security policy. Our compliance checking framework is based on organizational and security metadata to support refinement of high-level concepts to implementation specific instances. Our work uses the results of refinement calculus to express valid refinement patterns and their properties. Intuitively, a low-level security policy is compliant to a high-level security policy if there is a valid refinement path from the high-level security policy to the low-level security policy. Our model is capable of detecting violations of security policies, failures to meet obligations, and capability and modal conflicts.",Cryptography and Security

We first introduce a new formal framework, based on business perspective, where SoD constraints are analyzed introducing the activity concept. This notion helps organizations define SoD constraints in terms of business requirements and reduces management complexity in large-scale RBAC systems. The model enables the definition of a wide taxonomy of conflict types. In particular, object-based SoD is introduced using the SoD domain concept, namely the set of data in which transaction conflicts may occur. Together with the formalization of the above properties, in this paper we also show the effectiveness of our proposal: we have applied the model to a large, existing organization; results highlight the benefits of adopting the proposed model in terms of reduced administration cost.",Cryptography and Security

  Schemes","Strongly multiplicative linear secret sharing schemes (LSSS) have been a powerful tool for constructing secure multiparty computation protocols. However, it remains open whether or not there exist efficient constructions of strongly multiplicative LSSS from general LSSS. In this paper, we propose the new concept of a 3-multiplicative LSSS, and establish its relationship with strongly multiplicative LSSS. More precisely, we show that any 3-multiplicative LSSS is a strongly multiplicative LSSS, but the converse is not true; and that any strongly multiplicative LSSS can be efficiently converted into a 3-multiplicative LSSS. Furthermore, we apply 3-multiplicative LSSS to the computation of unbounded fan-in multiplication, which reduces its round complexity to four (from five of the previous protocol based on strongly multiplicative LSSS). We also give two constructions of 3-multiplicative LSSS from Reed-Muller codes and algebraic geometric codes. We believe that the construction and verification of 3-multiplicative LSSS are easier than those of strongly multiplicative LSSS. This presents a step forward in settling the open problem of efficient constructions of strongly multiplicative LSSS from general LSSS.",Cryptography and Security

  Initialization of Sensor Nodes","To establish secure (point-to-point and/or broadcast) communication channels among the nodes of a wireless sensor network is a fundamental task. To this end, a plethora of (socalled) key pre-distribution schemes have been proposed in the past. All these schemes, however, rely on shared secret(s), which are assumed to be somehow pre-loaded onto the sensor nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel method for secure initialization of sensor nodes based on a visual out-of-band channel. Using the proposed method, the administrator of a sensor network can distribute keys onto the sensor nodes, necessary to bootstrap key pre-distribution. Our secure initialization method requires only a little extra cost, is efficient and scalable with respect to the number of sensor nodes. Moreover, based on a usability study that we conducted, the method turns out to be quite user-friendly and easy to use by naive human users.",Cryptography and Security

The difficulty to decompose the ""Left-To-Right"" exponentiation into partial multiplications is overcome by modifying the public modulus to a number with known factorization. This fault model is justified here by a complete study of faulty prime numbers with a fixed size. The good success rate of this attack combined with its practicability raises the question of using faults for changing algebraic properties of finite field based cryptosystems.",Cryptography and Security

2404,Code injection attacks on harvard-architecture devices,"Harvard architecture CPU design is common in the embedded world. Examples of Harvard-based architecture devices are the Mica family of wireless sensors. Mica motes have limited memory and can process only very small packets. Stack-based buffer overflow techniques that inject code into the stack and then execute it are therefore not applicable. It has been a common belief that code injection is impossible on Harvard architectures. This paper presents a remote code injection attack for Mica sensors. We show how to exploit program vulnerabilities to permanently inject any piece of code into the program memory of an Atmel AVR-based sensor. To our knowledge, this is the first result that presents a code injection technique for such devices. Previous work only succeeded in injecting data or performing transient attacks. Injecting permanent code is more powerful since the attacker can gain full control of the target sensor. We also show that this attack can be used to inject a worm that can propagate through the wireless sensor network and possibly create a sensor botnet. Our attack combines different techniques such as return oriented programming and fake stack injection. We present implementation details and suggest some counter-measures.",Cryptography and Security

  Descriptions","Most behavioral detectors of malware remain specific to a given language and platform, mostly PE executables for Windows. The objective of this paper is to define a generic approach for behavioral detection based on two layers respectively responsible for abstraction and detection. The first abstraction layer remains specific to a platform and a language. This first layer interprets the collected instructions, API calls and arguments and classifies these operations as well as the involved objects according to their purpose in the malware lifecycle. The second detection layer remains generic and is totally interoperable between the different abstraction components. This layer relies on parallel automata parsing attribute-grammars where semantic rules are used for object typing (object classification) and object binding (data-flow). To feed detection and to experiment with our approach we have developed two different abstraction components: one processing system call traces from native code and one processing the VBScript interpreted language. The different experimentations have provided promising detection rates, in particular for script files (89%), with almost none false positives. In the case of process traces, the detection rate remains significant (51%) but could be increased by more sophisticated collection tools.",Cryptography and Security
2410,Formalization of malware through process calculi,"Since the seminal work from F. Cohen in the eighties, abstract virology has seen the apparition of successive viral models, all based on Turing-equivalent formalisms. But considering recent malware such as rootkits or k-ary codes, these viral models only partially cover these evolved threats. The problem is that Turing-equivalent models do not support interactive computations. New models have thus appeared, offering support for these evolved malware, but loosing the unified approach in the way. This article provides a basis for a unified malware model founded on process algebras and in particular the Join-Calculus. In terms of expressiveness, the new model supports the fundamental definitions based on self-replication and adds support for interactions, concurrency and non-termination allows the definition of more complex behaviors. Evolved malware such as rootkits can now be thoroughly modeled. In terms of detection and prevention, the fundamental results of undecidability and isolation still hold. However the process-based model has permitted to establish new results: identification of fragments from the Join-Calculus where malware detection becomes decidable, formal definition of the non-infection property, approximate solutions to restrict malware propagation.",Cryptography and Security

In this paper, we therefore propose a new definition of coercion resistance in a symbolic setting, based on an epistemic approach. Our definition is relatively simple and intuitive. It allows for a fine-grained formulation of coercion resistance and can be stated independently of a specific, symbolic protocol and adversary model. As a proof of concept, we apply our definition to three voting protocols. In particular, we carry out the first rigorous analysis of the recently proposed Civitas system. We precisely identify those conditions under which this system guarantees coercion resistance or fails to be coercion resistant.

  Computational Security","We consider repeated communication sessions between a RFID Tag (e.g., Radio Frequency Identification, RFID Tag) and a RFID Verifier. A proactive information theoretic security scheme is proposed. The scheme is based on the assumption that the information exchanged during at least one of every n successive communication sessions is not exposed to an adversary. The Tag and the Verifier maintain a vector of n entries that is repeatedly refreshed by pairwise xoring entries, with a new vector of n entries that is randomly chosen by the Tag and sent to the Verifier as a part of each communication session. The general case in which the adversary does not listen in k > 0 sessions among any n successive communication sessions is also considered. A lower bound of n(k+1) for the number of random numbers used during any n successive communication sessions is proven. In other words, we prove that an algorithm must use at least n(k+1) new random numbers during any n successive communication sessions. Then a randomized scheme that uses only O(n log n) new random numbers is presented. A computational secure scheme which is based on the information theoretic secure scheme is used to ensure that even in the case that the adversary listens in all the information exchanges, the communication between the Tag and the Verifier is secure.",Cryptography and Security

In particular, we partition the sequence of grid tasks into two interleaved sequences of task rounds, and we show how to use those rounds to devise the first general-purpose scheme that can catch all cheaters, even when cheaters collude. The main idea of this algorithm might at first seem counter-intuitive--we have the participants check each other's work. A naive implementation of this approach would, of course, be susceptible to collusion attacks, but we show that by, adapting efficient solutions to the parallel processor diagnosis problem, we can tolerate collusions of lazy cheaters, even if the number of such cheaters is a fraction of the total number of participants. We also include a simple economic analysis of cheaters in grid computations and a parameterization of the main deterrent that can be used against them--the probability of being caught.",Cryptography and Security

2435,Using Agent to Coordinate Web Services,"Traditionally, agent and web service are two separate research areas. We figure that, through agent communication, agent is suitable to coordinate web services. However, there exist agent communication problems due to the lack of uniform, cross-platform vocabulary. Fortunately, ontology defines a vocabulary. We thus propose a new agent communication layer and present the web ontology language (OWL)-based operational ontologies that provides a declarative description. It can be accessed by various engines to facilitate agent communication. Further, in our operational ontologies, we define the mental attitudes of agents that can be shared among other agents. Our architecture enhanced the 3APL agent platform, and it is implemented as an agent communication framework. Finally, we extended the framework to be compatible with the web ontology language for service (OWL-S), and then develop a movie recommendation system with four OWL-S semantic web services on the framework. The benefits of this work are: 1) dynamic web service coordination, 2) ontological reasoning through uniform representation, namely, the declarative description, and 3) easy reuse and extension of both ontology and engine through extending ontology.",Cryptography and Security

  the secure multicast communications","With the evolution of the Internet, multicast communications seem particularly well adapted for large scale commercial distribution applications, for example, the pay TV channels and secure videoconferencing. Key management for multicast remains an open topic in secure Communications today. Key management mainly has to do with the distribution and update of keying material during the group life. Several key tree based approach has been proposed by various authors to create and distribute the multicast group key in effective manner. There are different key management algorithms that facilitate efficient distribution and rekeying of the group key. These protocols normally add communication overhead as well as computation overhead at the group key controller and at the group members.

2437,"Coarse-grained Dynamic Taint Analysis for Defeating Control and
  Non-control Data Attacks","Memory corruption attacks remain the primary threat for computer security. Information flow tracking or taint analysis has been proven to be effective against most memory corruption attacks. However, there are two shortcomings with current taint analysis based techniques. First, these techniques cause application slowdown by about 76% thereby limiting their practicality. Second, these techniques cannot handle non-control data attacks i.e., attacks that do not overwrite control data such as return address, but instead overwrite critical application configuration data or user identity data. In this work, to address these problems, we describe a coarse-grained taint analysis technique that uses information flow tracking at the level of application data objects. We propagate a one-bit taint over each application object that is modified by untrusted data thereby reducing the taint management overhead considerably. We performed extensive experimental evaluation of our approach and show that it can detect all critical attacks such as buffer overflows, and format string attacks, including non-control data attacks. Unlike the currently known approaches that can detect such a wide range of attacks, our approach does not require the source code or any hardware extensions. Run-time performance overhead evaluation shows that, on an average, our approach causes application slowdown by only 37% which is an order of magnitude improvement over existing approaches. Finally, since our approach performs run-time binary instrumentation, it is easier to integrate it with existing applications and systems.",Cryptography and Security
2438,"Shedding Light on RFID Distance Bounding Protocols and Terrorist Fraud
  Attacks","The vast majority of RFID authentication protocols assume the proximity between readers and tags due to the limited range of the radio channel. However, in real scenarios an intruder can be located between the prover (tag) and the verifier (reader) and trick this last one into thinking that the prover is in close proximity. This attack is generally known as a relay attack in which scope distance fraud, mafia fraud and terrorist attacks are included. Distance bounding protocols represent a promising countermeasure to hinder relay attacks. Several protocols have been proposed during the last years but vulnerabilities of major or minor relevance have been identified in most of them. In 2008, Kim et al. [1] proposed a new distance bounding protocol with the objective of being the best in terms of security, privacy, tag computational overhead and fault tolerance. In this paper, we analyze this protocol and we present a passive full disclosure attack, which allows an adversary to discover the long-term secret key of the tag. The presented attack is very relevant, since no security objectives are met in Kim et al.'s protocol. Then, design guidelines are introduced with the aim of facilitating protocol designers the stimulating task of designing secure and efficient schemes against relay attacks. Finally a new protocol, named Hitomi and inspired by [1], is designed conforming the guidelines proposed previously.",Cryptography and Security
2439,Client-Server Password Recovery (Extended Abstract),"Human memory is not perfect - people constantly memorize new facts and forget old ones. One example is forgetting a password, a common problem raised at IT help desks. We present several protocols that allow a user to automatically recover a password from a server using partial knowledge of the password. These protocols can be easily adapted to the personal entropy setting, where a user can recover a password only if he can answer a large enough subset of personal questions.   We introduce client-server password recovery methods, in which the recovery data are stored at the server, and the recovery procedures are integrated into the login procedures. These methods apply to two of the most common types of password based authentication systems. The security of these solutions is significantly better than the security of presently proposed password recovery schemes. Our protocols are based on a variation of threshold encryption that may be of independent interest.",Cryptography and Security

This implementation of an Intrusion Detection System distinguishes between the traffic coming from clients and the traffic originated from the attackers, in an attempt to simultaneously mitigate the problems of both latency and security. We then present the results of a series of stress and scalability tests, and suggest a number of potential uses for such a system. As computer attacks are becoming more and more difficult to identify the need for better and more efficient intrusion detection systems increases. The main problem with current intrusion detection systems is high rate of false alarms. Using honeypots provides effective solution to increase the security.",Cryptography and Security

This gives rise to the need of an incidence handling capability which is necessary for rapidly detecting incidents, minimizing loss and destruction, mitigating the weaknesses that were exploited and restoring the computing services. Incidence response has always been an important aspect of information security but it is often overlooked by security administrators. in this paper, we propose an automated system which will handle the security threats and make the computer network capable enough to withstand any kind of attack. we also present the state-of-the-art technology in computer, network and software which is required to build such a system.",Cryptography and Security

Previous proposals of such protocols were based on PRF computations. Our protocol can instead be used on low-cost tags that may be incapable of computing standard PRFs. Moreover, since the underlying computations in HB protocols are very efficient, our protocol also reduces reader load compared to PRF-based protocols.   We suggest a tree-based approach that replaces the PRF-based authentication from prior work with a procedure such as HB+ or HB#. We optimize the tree- traversal stage through usage of a ""light version"" of the underlying protocol and shared random challenges across all levels of the tree. This provides significant reduction of the communication resources, resulting in a privacy-preserving protocol almost as efficient as the underlying HB+ or HB#",Cryptography and Security
2448,"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale: Implications of Data Remanence on
  the Use of RAM for True Random Number Generation on RFID Tags (RFIDSec 2009)","Random number generation is a fundamental security primitive for RFID devices. However, even this relatively simple requirement is beyond the capacity of today's average RFID tag. A recently proposed solution, Fingerprint Extraction and Random Number Generation in SRAM (FERNS) [14, 15], involves the use of onboard RAM as the source of ""true"" randomness. Unfortunately, practical considerations prevent this approach from reaching its full potential. First, this method must compete with other system functionalities for use of memory. Thus, the amount of uninitialized RAM available for utilization as a randomness generator may be severely restricted. Second, RAM is subject to data remanence; there is a time period after losing power during which stored data remains intact in memory. This means that after a portion of memory has been used for entropy collection once it will require a relatively extended period of time without power before it can be reused. In a usable RFID based security application, which requires multiple or long random numbers, this may lead to unacceptably high delays.   In this paper, we show that data remanence negatively affects RAM based random number generation. We demonstrate the practical considerations that must be taken into account when using RAM as an entropy source. We also discuss the implementation of a true random number generator on Intel's WISP RFID tag, which is the first such implementation to the authors' best knowledge. By relating this to the requirements of some popular RFID authentication protocols, we assess the (im)practicality of utilizing memory based randomness techniques on resource constrained devices.",Cryptography and Security

2454,"Image Compression with Iterated Function Systems, Finite Automata and
  Zerotrees: Grand Unification","Fractal image compression, Culik's image compression and zerotree prediction coding of wavelet image decomposition coefficients succeed only because typical images being compressed possess a significant degree of self-similarity. Besides the common concept, these methods turn out to be even more tightly related, to the point of algorithmical reducibility of one technique to another. The goal of the present paper is to demonstrate these relations.   The paper offers a plain-term interpretation of Culik's image compression, in regular image processing terms, without resorting to finite state machines and similar lofty language. The interpretation is shown to be algorithmically related to an IFS fractal image compression method: an IFS can be exactly transformed into Culik's image code. Using this transformation, we will prove that in a self-similar (part of an) image any zero wavelet coefficient is the root of a zerotree, or its branch.   The paper discusses the zerotree coding of (wavelet/projection) coefficients as a common predictor/corrector, applied vertically through different layers of a multiresolutional decomposition, rather than within the same view. This interpretation leads to an insight into the evolution of image compression techniques: from a causal single-layer prediction, to non-causal same-view predictions (wavelet decomposition among others) and to a causal cross-layer prediction (zero-trees, Culik's method).",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

We have demonstrated this by analyzing the effect of concentrated noise on a typical decision making process of a simplified two candidate voting model where our theorem establishes the lower bounds to a critical breakdown point of election (or decision) result by the bottom-up matching process are greater than the exact bound of the global matching process implying that the former regional process is capable of accommodating a higher level of noise than the latter global process before the result of decision overturns. We present a convincing experimental verification supporting not only the theory by a white-black flag recognition problem in the presence of localized noise but also the validity of the conjecture by a facial recognition problem that the theorem remains valid for other decision making processes involving an important dimension-reducing transform such as principal component analysis or a Gabor transform.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The truncated probability is partly determined by prior knowledge of the objects and partly learned from data. Some experiments on sequence quality and object segmentation and recognition from stereo data are presented. The article recovers classic concepts from object recognition (grouping, geometric hashing, alignment) from the probabilistic perspective and adds insight into the optimal ordering of object hypotheses for evaluation.

The task of estimating radial distortion is to find a radial distortion model that allows easy undistortion as well as satisfactory accuracy. This paper presents a new piecewise radial distortion model with easy analytical undistortion formula. The motivation for seeking a piecewise radial distortion model is that, when a camera is resulted in a low quality during manufacturing, the nonlinear radial distortion can be complex. Using low order polynomials to approximate the radial distortion might not be precise enough. On the other hand, higher order polynomials suffer from the inverse problem. With the new piecewise radial distortion function, more flexibility is obtained and the radial undistortion can be performed analytically.

A family of simplified geometric distortion models is proposed, which are either simple polynomials or the rational functions of polynomials. Analytical geometric undistortion is possible using two of the distortion functions discussed in this paper and their performance can be improved by applying a piecewise fitting idea.

Because $k_1\ne k_2$, the supports of the basis elements are rectangles, and the corresponding transform is known as the {\em rectangular wavelet transform}. We prove that if one-dimensional wavelet basis has $M$ dual vanishing moments then the rate of approximation by $N$ coefficients of rectangular wavelet transform is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-M}\log^C N)$ for functions with mixed derivative of order $M$ in each direction.   The square wavelet transform yields the approximation rate is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-M/2})$ for functions with all derivatives of the total order $M$. Thus, the rectangular wavelet transform can outperform the square one if an image has a mixed derivative.

In this paper, we firstly review basic results about convergence and numerical analysis of usual GVF schemes. We point out that GVF presents numerical problems due to discontinuities image intensity. This point is considered from a practical viewpoint from which the GVF parameters must follow a relationship in order to improve numerical convergence. Besides, we present an analytical analysis of the GVF dependency from the parameters values.

Despite of its widespread use, the notion of ""image information content"" is still ill defined, intuitive, and ambiguous. Most often, it is used in the Shannon's sense, which means information content assessment averaged over the whole signal ensemble. Humans, however,rarely resort to such estimates. They are very effective in decomposing images into their meaningful constituents and focusing attention to the perceptually relevant image parts. We posit that following the latest findings in human attention vision studies and the concepts of Kolmogorov's complexity theory an unorthodox segmentation approach can be proposed that provides effective image decomposition to information preserving image fragments well suited for subsequent image interpretation.

2481,Automatic Face Recognition System Based on Local Fourier-Bessel Features,"We present an automatic face verification system inspired by known properties of biological systems. In the proposed algorithm the whole image is converted from the spatial to polar frequency domain by a Fourier-Bessel Transform (FBT). Using the whole image is compared to the case where only face image regions (local analysis) are considered. The resulting representations are embedded in a dissimilarity space, where each image is represented by its distance to all the other images, and a Pseudo-Fisher discriminator is built. Verification test results on the FERET database showed that the local-based algorithm outperforms the global-FBT version. The local-FBT algorithm performed as state-of-the-art methods under different testing conditions, indicating that the proposed system is highly robust for expression, age, and illumination variations. We also evaluated the performance of the proposed system under strong occlusion conditions and found that it is highly robust for up to 50% of face occlusion. Finally, we automated completely the verification system by implementing face and eye detection algorithms. Under this condition, the local approach was only slightly superior to the global approach.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2482,Face Recognition Based on Polar Frequency Features,"A novel biologically motivated face recognition algorithm based on polar frequency is presented. Polar frequency descriptors are extracted from face images by Fourier-Bessel transform (FBT). Next, the Euclidean distance between all images is computed and each image is now represented by its dissimilarity to the other images. A Pseudo-Fisher Linear Discriminant was built on this dissimilarity space. The performance of Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) descriptors, and a combination of both feature types was also evaluated. The algorithms were tested on a 40- and 1196-subjects face database (ORL and FERET, respectively). With 5 images per subject in the training and test datasets, error rate on the ORL database was 3.8, 1.25 and 0.2% for the FBT, DFT, and the combined classifier, respectively, as compared to 2.6% achieved by the best previous algorithm. The most informative polar frequency features were concentrated at low-to-medium angular frequencies coupled to low radial frequencies. On the FERET database, where an affine normalization pre-processing was applied, the FBT algorithm outperformed only the PCA in a rank recognition test. However, it achieved performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods when evaluated by verification tests. These results indicate the high informative value of the polar frequency content of face images in relation to recognition and verification tasks, and that the Cartesian frequency content can complement information about the subjects' identity, but possibly only when the images are not pre-normalized. Possible implications for human face recognition are discussed.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2483,"Face Verification in Polar Frequency Domain: a Biologically Motivated
  Approach","We present a novel local-based face verification system whose components are analogous to those of biological systems. In the proposed system, after global registration and normalization, three eye regions are converted from the spatial to polar frequency domain by a Fourier-Bessel Transform. The resulting representations are embedded in a dissimilarity space, where each image is represented by its distance to all the other images. In this dissimilarity space a Pseudo-Fisher discriminator is built. ROC and equal error rate verification test results on the FERET database showed that the system performed at least as state-of-the-art methods and better than a system based on polar Fourier features. The local-based system is especially robust to facial expression and age variations, but sensitive to registration errors.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2484,"Retinal Vessel Segmentation Using the 2-D Morlet Wavelet and Supervised
  Classification","We present a method for automated segmentation of the vasculature in retinal images. The method produces segmentations by classifying each image pixel as vessel or non-vessel, based on the pixel's feature vector. Feature vectors are composed of the pixel's intensity and continuous two-dimensional Morlet wavelet transform responses taken at multiple scales. The Morlet wavelet is capable of tuning to specific frequencies, thus allowing noise filtering and vessel enhancement in a single step. We use a Bayesian classifier with class-conditional probability density functions (likelihoods) described as Gaussian mixtures, yielding a fast classification, while being able to model complex decision surfaces and compare its performance with the linear minimum squared error classifier. The probability distributions are estimated based on a training set of labeled pixels obtained from manual segmentations. The method's performance is evaluated on publicly available DRIVE and STARE databases of manually labeled non-mydriatic images. On the DRIVE database, it achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.9598, being slightly superior than that presented by the method of Staal et al.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2485,"A decision support system for ship identification based on the curvature
  scale space representation","In this paper, a decision support system for ship identification is presented. The system receives as input a silhouette of the vessel to be identified, previously extracted from a side view of the object. This view could have been acquired with imaging sensors operating at different spectral ranges (CCD, FLIR, image intensifier). The input silhouette is preprocessed and compared to those stored in a database, retrieving a small number of potential matches ranked by their similarity to the target silhouette. This set of potential matches is presented to the system operator, who makes the final ship identification. This system makes use of an evolved version of the Curvature Scale Space (CSS) representation. In the proposed approach, it is curvature extrema, instead of zero crossings, that are tracked during silhouette evolution, hence improving robustness and enabling to cope successfully with cases where the standard CCS representation is found to be unstable. Also, the use of local curvature was replaced with the more robust concept of lobe concavity, with significant additional gains in performance. Experimental results on actual operational imagery prove the excellent performance and robustness of the developed method.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

It is conjectured, and to a certain extent demonstrated here, that it is possible for advanced civilizations to factor in erosion by natural processes into a large scale design so that main features be preserved even with the passage of millions of years. Alternatively viewed, even without such intent embedded in a design left for posterity, it is possible that a gigantic construction may naturally decay in such a way that even cataclysmic (massive) events may leave sufficient information intact with the passage of time, provided one changes the point of view from high resolution images to enhanced blurred renderings of the sites in question.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2489,"Multilevel Thresholding for Image Segmentation through a Fast
  Statistical Recursive Algorithm","A novel algorithm is proposed for segmenting an image into multiple levels using its mean and variance. Starting from the extreme pixel values at both ends of the histogram plot, the algorithm is applied recursively on sub-ranges computed from the previous step, so as to find a threshold level and a new sub-range for the next step, until no significant improvement in image quality can be achieved. The method makes use of the fact that a number of distributions tend towards Dirac delta function, peaking at the mean, in the limiting condition of vanishing variance. The procedure naturally provides for variable size segmentation with bigger blocks near the extreme pixel values and finer divisions around the mean or other chosen value for better visualization. Experiments on a variety of images show that the new algorithm effectively segments the image in computationally very less time.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Images are divided into sub-images based some standard image attributes and thresholding technique is employed over the sub-images. The present algorithm makes use of the thresholds of neighboring sub-images to calculate a range of values. The image continuity is taken care by choosing the threshold of the sub-image under consideration to lie within the above range. After examining the average range values for various sub-image sizes of a variety of images, it was found that the range of acceptable threshold values is substantially high, justifying our assumption of exploiting the freedom of range for bringing out local details.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2491,Matching Edges in Images ; Application to Face Recognition,"This communication describes a representation of images as a set of edges characterized by their position and orientation. This representation allows the comparison of two images and the computation of their similarity. The first step in this computation of similarity is the seach of a geometrical basis of the two dimensional space where the two images are represented simultaneously after transformation of one of them. Presently, this simultaneous representation takes into account a shift and a scaling ; it may be extended to rotations or other global geometrical transformations. An elementary probabilistic computation shows that a sufficient but not excessive number of trials (a few tens) ensures that the exhibition of this common basis is guaranteed in spite of possible errors in the detection of edges. When this first step is performed, the search of similarity between the two images reduces to counting the coincidence of edges in the two images. The approach may be applied to many problems of pattern matching ; it was checked on face recognition.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The brain also has a mechanism to search from coarse to fine. In this paper, we present a feature extractor and an associated hierarchical searching model to simulate such processes. With the hierarchical representation of the object, coarse scanning is done through the matching of the larger scale and precise localization is conducted through the matching of the smaller scale.

For recognition experiments we used 5151 face images of 1311 persons from different sets of the FERET and AR databases that allow to analyze how recognition accuracy is affected by the change of facial expressions, illumination, and aging. Recognition experiments with the FERET database (containing photographs of 1196 persons) showed that our method can achieve maximal 97-98% first one recognition rate and 0.3-0.4% Equal Error Rate.

Extracted features are passed to the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) -based recognition method. The results of face recognition experiments using expression variant faces showed that the proposed method could achieve higher recognition accuracy than many other methods. For development and testing we used facial images from the AR and FERET databases. Using facial photographs of more than one thousand persons from the FERET database the proposed method achieved 96.6-98.9% first one recognition rate and 0.2-0.6% Equal Error Rate (EER).,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  De-noising, Segmentation, Pattern, Texture, Lines, Gestalt and Occlusion","Regularization functionals that lower level set boundary length when used with L^1 fidelity functionals on signal de-noising on images create artifacts. These are (i) rounding of corners, (ii) shrinking of radii, (iii) shrinking of cusps, and (iv) non-smoothing of staircasing. Regularity functionals based upon total curvature of level set boundaries do not create artifacts (i) and (ii). An adjusted fidelity term based on the flat norm on the current (a distributional graph) representing the density of curvature of level sets boundaries can minimize (iii) by weighting the position of a cusp. A regularity term to eliminate staircasing can be based upon the mass of the current representing the graph of an image function or its second derivatives.

  upsampled images","Raster images can have a range of various distortions connected to their raster structure. Upsampling them might in effect substantially yield the raster structure of the original image, known as aliasing. The upsampling itself may introduce aliasing into the upsampled image as well. The presented method attempts to remove the aliasing using frequency filters based on the discrete fast Fourier transform, and applied directionally in certain regions placed along the edges in the image.   As opposed to some anisotropic smoothing methods, the presented algorithm aims to selectively reduce only the aliasing, preserving the sharpness of image details.   The method can be used as a post--processing filter along with various upsampling algorithms. It was experimentally shown that the method can improve the visual quality of the upsampled images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2498,"Total Variation Minimization and Graph Cuts for Moving Objects
  Segmentation","In this paper, we are interested in the application to video segmentation of the discrete shape optimization problem involving the shape weighted perimeter and an additional term depending on a parameter. Based on recent works and in particular the one of Darbon and Sigelle, we justify the equivalence of the shape optimization problem and a weighted total variation regularization. For solving this problem, we adapt the projection algorithm proposed recently for solving the basic TV regularization problem. Another solution to the shape optimization investigated here is the graph cut technique. Both methods have the advantage to lead to a global minimum. Since we can distinguish moving objects from static elements of a scene by analyzing norm of the optical flow vectors, we choose the optical flow norm as initial data. In order to have the contour as close as possible to an edge in the image, we use a classical edge detector function as the weight of the weighted total variation. This model has been used in one of our former works. We also apply the same methods to a video segmentation model used by Jehan-Besson, Barlaud and Aubert. In this case, only standard perimeter is incorporated in the shape functional. We also propose another way for finding moving objects by using an a contrario detection of objects on the image obtained by solving the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi Total Variation regularization problem.We can notice the segmentation can be associated to a level set in the former methods.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2502,Camera motion estimation through planar deformation determination,"In this paper, we propose a global method for estimating the motion of a camera which films a static scene. Our approach is direct, fast and robust, and deals with adjacent frames of a sequence. It is based on a quadratic approximation of the deformation between two images, in the case of a scene with constant depth in the camera coordinate system. This condition is very restrictive but we show that provided translation and depth inverse variations are small enough, the error on optical flow involved by the approximation of depths by a constant is small. In this context, we propose a new model of camera motion, that allows to separate the image deformation in a similarity and a ``purely'' projective application, due to change of optical axis direction. This model leads to a quadratic approximation of image deformation that we estimate with an M-estimator; we can immediatly deduce camera motion parameters.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2503,"A higher-order active contour model of a `gas of circles' and its
  application to tree crown extraction","Many image processing problems involve identifying the region in the image domain occupied by a given entity in the scene. Automatic solution of these problems requires models that incorporate significant prior knowledge about the shape of the region. Many methods for including such knowledge run into difficulties when the topology of the region is unknown a priori, for example when the entity is composed of an unknown number of similar objects. Higher-order active contours (HOACs) represent one method for the modelling of non-trivial prior knowledge about shape without necessarily constraining region topology, via the inclusion of non-local interactions between region boundary points in the energy defining the model. The case of an unknown number of circular objects arises in a number of domains, e.g. medical, biological, nanotechnological, and remote sensing imagery. Regions composed of an a priori unknown number of circles may be referred to as a `gas of circles'. In this report, we present a HOAC model of a `gas of circles'. In order to guarantee stable circles, we conduct a stability analysis via a functional Taylor expansion of the HOAC energy around a circular shape. This analysis fixes one of the model parameters in terms of the others and constrains the rest. In conjunction with a suitable likelihood energy, we apply the model to the extraction of tree crowns from aerial imagery, and show that the new model outperforms other techniques.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

New generation satellites offer a sub-metric spatial resolution, in which it is possible (and necessary) to develop methods at object level rather than at pixel level, and to exploit structural features of objects. With this aim, a method to generate structural object models from manually segmented images has been developed. To generate the model from non-segmented images, extraction of the objects from the sample images is required. A hybrid method of extraction (both in terms of input sources and segmentation algorithms) is proposed: A region based segmentation is applied on a 10 meter resolution multi-spectral image.

The problem is substantially more difficult with only a single low-resolution image on hand. The image reconstruction methods designed primarily for denoising is insufficient for super-resolution problem in the sense that it tends to oversmooth images with essentially no noise.

  spaces","Kernel estimation techniques, such as mean shift, suffer from one major drawback: the kernel bandwidth selection. The bandwidth can be fixed for all the data set or can vary at each points. Automatic bandwidth selection becomes a real challenge in case of multidimensional heterogeneous features. This paper presents a solution to this problem. It is an extension of \cite{Comaniciu03a} which was based on the fundamental property of normal distributions regarding the bias of the normalized density gradient. The selection is done iteratively for each type of features, by looking for the stability of local bandwidth estimates across a predefined range of bandwidths.

The validity of the method is demonstrated in the context of color image segmentation based on a 5-dimensional space.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2516,"Supervised learning on graphs of spatio-temporal similarity in satellite
  image sequences","High resolution satellite image sequences are multidimensional signals composed of spatio-temporal patterns associated to numerous and various phenomena. Bayesian methods have been previously proposed in (Heas and Datcu, 2005) to code the information contained in satellite image sequences in a graph representation using Bayesian methods. Based on such a representation, this paper further presents a supervised learning methodology of semantics associated to spatio-temporal patterns occurring in satellite image sequences. It enables the recognition and the probabilistic retrieval of similar events. Indeed, graphs are attached to statistical models for spatio-temporal processes, which at their turn describe physical changes in the observed scene. Therefore, we adjust a parametric model evaluating similarity types between graph patterns in order to represent user-specific semantics attached to spatio-temporal phenomena. The learning step is performed by the incremental definition of similarity types via user-provided spatio-temporal pattern examples attached to positive or/and negative semantics. From these examples, probabilities are inferred using a Bayesian network and a Dirichlet model. This enables to links user interest to a specific similarity model between graph patterns. According to the current state of learning, semantic posterior probabilities are updated for all possible graph patterns so that similar spatio-temporal phenomena can be recognized and retrieved from the image sequence. Few experiments performed on a multi-spectral SPOT image sequence illustrate the proposed spatio-temporal recognition method.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2517,"Graph rigidity, Cyclic Belief Propagation and Point Pattern Matching","A recent paper \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} proposed a provably optimal, polynomial time method for performing near-isometric point pattern matching by means of exact probabilistic inference in a chordal graphical model. Their fundamental result is that the chordal graph in question is shown to be globally rigid, implying that exact inference provides the same matching solution as exact inference in a complete graphical model. This implies that the algorithm is optimal when there is no noise in the point patterns. In this paper, we present a new graph which is also globally rigid but has an advantage over the graph proposed in \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06}: its maximal clique size is smaller, rendering inference significantly more efficient. However, our graph is not chordal and thus standard Junction Tree algorithms cannot be directly applied. Nevertheless, we show that loopy belief propagation in such a graph converges to the optimal solution. This allows us to retain the optimality guarantee in the noiseless case, while substantially reducing both memory requirements and processing time. Our experimental results show that the accuracy of the proposed solution is indistinguishable from that of \cite{CaeCaeSchBar06} when there is noise in the point patterns.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

On the other hand, while belief-propagation techniques are often unable to deal with high-order models due to the explosion in the size of messages, we avoid this problem by approximating our high-order prior model using a Gaussian mixture. By using such an approximation, we are able to inpaint images quickly while at the same time retaining good visual results.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Using the view-generalization function, an observer can perform Bayes-optimal 3D object recognition given one or more 2D training views directly, without the need for a separate model acquisition step. The paper shows that view generalization functions can be computationally practical by restating two widely-used methods, the eigenspace and linear combination of views approaches, in a view generalization framework.

2523,View Based Methods can achieve Bayes-Optimal 3D Recognition,"This paper proves that visual object recognition systems using only 2D Euclidean similarity measurements to compare object views against previously seen views can achieve the same recognition performance as observers having access to all coordinate information and able of using arbitrary 3D models internally. Furthermore, it demonstrates that such systems do not require more training views than Bayes-optimal 3D model-based systems. For building computer vision systems, these results imply that using view-based or appearance-based techniques with carefully constructed combination of evidence mechanisms may not be at a disadvantage relative to 3D model-based systems. For computational approaches to human vision, they show that it is impossible to distinguish view-based and 3D model-based techniques for 3D object recognition solely by comparing the performance achievable by human and 3D model-based systems.}",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2524,Hierarchy construction schemes within the Scale set framework,"Segmentation algorithms based on an energy minimisation framework often depend on a scale parameter which balances a fit to data and a regularising term. Irregular pyramids are defined as a stack of graphs successively reduced. Within this framework, the scale is often defined implicitly as the height in the pyramid. However, each level of an irregular pyramid can not usually be readily associated to the global optimum of an energy or a global criterion on the base level graph. This last drawback is addressed by the scale set framework designed by Guigues. The methods designed by this author allow to build a hierarchy and to design cuts within this hierarchy which globally minimise an energy. This paper studies the influence of the construction scheme of the initial hierarchy on the resulting optimal cuts. We propose one sequential and one parallel method with two variations within both. Our sequential methods provide partitions near the global optima while parallel methods require less execution times than the sequential method of Guigues even on sequential machines.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2527,Automatic Text Area Segmentation in Natural Images,"We present a hierarchical method for segmenting text areas in natural images. The method assumes that the text is written with a contrasting color on a more or less uniform background. But no assumption is made regarding the language or character set used to write the text. In particular, the text can contain simple graphics or symbols. The key feature of our approach is that we first concentrate on finding the background of the text, before testing whether there is actually text on the background. Since uniform areas are easy to find in natural images, and since text backgrounds define areas which contain ""holes"" (where the text is written) we thus look for uniform areas containing ""holes"" and label them as text backgrounds candidates. Each candidate area is then further tested for the presence of text within its convex hull. We tested our method on a database of 65 images including English and Urdu text. The method correctly segmented all the text areas in 63 of these images, and in only 4 of these were areas that do not contain text also segmented.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  Aggregate Mixture Grading","We show the potential for classifying images of mixtures of aggregate, based themselves on varying, albeit well-defined, sizes and shapes, in order to provide a far more effective approach compared to the classification of individual sizes and shapes. While a dominant (additive, stationary) Gaussian noise component in image data will ensure that wavelet coefficients are of Gaussian distribution, long tailed distributions (symptomatic, for example, of extreme values) may well hold in practice for wavelet coefficients. Energy (2nd order moment) has often been used for image characterization for image content-based retrieval, and higher order moments may be important also, not least for capturing long tailed distributional behavior. In this work, we assess 2nd, 3rd and 4th order moments of multiresolution transform -- wavelet and curvelet transform -- coefficients as features. As analysis methodology, taking account of image types, multiresolution transforms, and moments of coefficients in the scales or bands, we use correspondence analysis as well as k-nearest neighbors supervised classification.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Bayer colour filters array is considered as an array of neutral filters in a quasimonochromatic light. If the camera's response function to the desirable light source is known then one can calculate correction coefficients to reconstruct oversaturated images. Reconstructed images are linearized in order to provide a linear high dynamic range images for optical-digital imaging systems.

Our method is based on cubical images with direct adjacency, also called (6,26)-connectivity images in discrete geometry. According to the fact that there are only six types of local surface points in 3D and a discrete version of the well-known Gauss-Bonnett Theorem in differential geometry, we first determine the genus of a closed 2D-connected component (a closed digital surface). Then, we use Alexander duality to obtain the homology groups of a 3D object in 3D space.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2532,A New Algorithm for Interactive Structural Image Segmentation,"This paper proposes a novel algorithm for the problem of structural image segmentation through an interactive model-based approach. Interaction is expressed in the model creation, which is done according to user traces drawn over a given input image. Both model and input are then represented by means of attributed relational graphs derived on the fly. Appearance features are taken into account as object attributes and structural properties are expressed as relational attributes. To cope with possible topological differences between both graphs, a new structure called the deformation graph is introduced. The segmentation process corresponds to finding a labelling of the input graph that minimizes the deformations introduced in the model when it is updated with input information. This approach has shown to be faster than other segmentation methods, with competitive output quality. Therefore, the method solves the problem of multiple label segmentation in an efficient way. Encouraging results on both natural and target-specific color images, as well as examples showing the reusability of the model, are presented and discussed.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The texture similar, the spatial closer and the color similar functions are used to filter the image.The effect of the weighting function parameters is qualitatively analyzed also. In contrast with the standard bilateral filter and the simulation results for the real airport runway image show that the multilateral filtering is more effective than the standard bilateral filtering.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  observations","In this paper, we focus on statistical region-based active contour models where image features (e.g. intensity) are random variables whose distribution belongs to some parametric family (e.g. exponential) rather than confining ourselves to the special Gaussian case. Using shape derivation tools, our effort focuses on constructing a general expression for the derivative of the energy (with respect to a domain) and derive the corresponding evolution speed. A general result is stated within the framework of multi-parameter exponential family. More particularly, when using Maximum Likelihood estimators, the evolution speed has a closed-form expression that depends simply on the probability density function, while complicating additive terms appear when using other estimators, e.g. moments method. Experimental results on both synthesized and real images demonstrate the applicability of our approach.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2536,Region-based active contour with noise and shape priors,"In this paper, we propose to combine formally noise and shape priors in region-based active contours.

On the other hand, translation and scale invariant Legendre moments are considered to incorporate the shape prior (e.g. fidelity to a reference shape). The combination of the two prior terms in the active contour functional yields the final evolution equation whose evolution speed is rigorously derived using shape derivative tools. Experimental results on both synthetic images and real life cardiac echography data clearly demonstrate the robustness to initialization and noise, flexibility and large potential applicability of our segmentation algorithm.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  Reduction","Feature selection is a pattern recognition approach to choose important variables according to some criteria to distinguish or explain certain phenomena. There are many genomic and proteomic applications which rely on feature selection to answer questions such as: selecting signature genes which are informative about some biological state, e.g. normal tissues and several types of cancer; or defining a network of prediction or inference among elements such as genes, proteins, external stimuli and other elements of interest. In these applications, a recurrent problem is the lack of samples to perform an adequate estimate of the joint probabilities between element states. A myriad of feature selection algorithms and criterion functions are proposed, although it is difficult to point the best solution in general. The intent of this work is to provide an open-source multiplataform graphical environment to apply, test and compare many feature selection approaches suitable to be used in bioinformatics problems.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2538,"Directional Cross Diamond Search Algorithm for Fast Block Motion
  Estimation","In block-matching motion estimation (BMME), the search patterns have a significant impact on the algorithm's performance, both the search speed and the search quality. The search pattern should be designed to fit the motion vector probability (MVP) distribution characteristics of the real-world sequences. In this paper, we build a directional model of MVP distribution to describe the directional-center-biased characteristic of the MVP distribution and the directional characteristics of the conditional MVP distribution more exactly based on the detailed statistical data of motion vectors of eighteen popular sequences. Three directional search patterns are firstly designed by utilizing the directional characteristics and they are the smallest search patterns among the popular ones. A new algorithm is proposed using the horizontal cross search pattern as the initial step and the horizontal/vertical diamond search pattern as the subsequent step for the fast BMME, which is called the directional cross diamond search (DCDS) algorithm. The DCDS algorithm can obtain the motion vector with fewer search points than CDS, DS or HEXBS while maintaining the similar or even better search quality. The gain on speedup of DCDS over CDS or DS can be up to 54.9%. The simulation results show that DCDS is efficient, effective and robust, and it can always give the faster search speed on different sequences than other fast block-matching algorithm in common use.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2540,Classification of curves in 2D and 3D via affine integral signatures,"We propose a robust classification algorithm for curves in 2D and 3D, under the special and full groups of affine transformations. To each plane or spatial curve we assign a plane signature curve. Curves, equivalent under an affine transformation, have the same signature. The signatures introduced in this paper are based on integral invariants, which behave much better on noisy images than classically known differential invariants. The comparison with other types of invariants is given in the introduction. Though the integral invariants for planar curves were known before, the affine integral invariants for spatial curves are proposed here for the first time. Using the inductive variation of the moving frame method we compute affine invariants in terms of Euclidean invariants. We present two types of signatures, the global signature and the local signature. Both signatures are independent of parameterization (curve sampling). The global signature depends on the choice of the initial point and does not allow us to compare fragments of curves, and is therefore sensitive to occlusions. The local signature, although is slightly more sensitive to noise, is independent of the choice of the initial point and is not sensitive to occlusions in an image. It helps establish local equivalence of curves. The robustness of these invariants and signatures in their application to the problem of classification of noisy spatial curves extracted from a 3D object is analyzed.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  4: Simple, generic and robust extraction of grains in granular materials
  obtained by X-ray tomography","This paper proposes a simple, generic and robust method to extract the grains from experimental tridimensionnal images of granular materials obtained by X-ray tomography. This extraction has two steps: segmentation and splitting. For the segmentation step, if there is a sufficient contrast between the different components, a classical threshold procedure followed by a succession of morphological filters can be applied. If not, and if the boundary needs to be localized precisely, a watershed transformation controlled by labels is applied. The basement of this transformation is to localize a label included in the component and another label in the component complementary. A ""soft"" threshold following by an opening is applied on the initial image to localize a label in a component. For any segmentation procedure, the visualisation shows a problem: some groups of two grains, close one to each other, become connected. So if a classical cluster procedure is applied on the segmented binary image, these numerical connected grains are considered as a single grain. To overcome this problem, we applied a procedure introduced by L. Vincent in 1993. This grains extraction is tested for various complexes porous media and granular material, to predict various properties (diffusion, electrical conductivity, deformation field) in a good agreement with experiment data.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Therefore, searching for figures and extracting figure data are important problems. To the best of our knowledge, there exists no tool to automatically extract data from figures in digital documents. If we can extract data from these images automatically and store them in a database, an end-user can query and combine data from multiple digital documents simultaneously and efficiently.

Since the most common distortion can be modelled as radial distortion, we illustrate the method using the Harris radial distortion model, but the method is applicable to any distortion model. The method is based on transforming the edgels of the distorted image to a 1-D angular Hough space, and optimizing the distortion correction parameters which minimize the entropy of the corresponding normalized histogram. Properly corrected imagery will have fewer curved lines, and therefore less spread in Hough space. Since the method does not rely on any image structure beyond the existence of edgels sharing some common orientations and does not use edge fitting, it is applicable to a wide variety of image types. For instance, it can be applied equally well to images of texture with weak but dominant orientations, or images with strong vanishing points. Finally, the method is performed on both synthetic and real data revealing that it is particularly robust to noise.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

In particular, we design a low complexity solution that is able to exploit the properties of the data manifolds with a graph-based algorithm. Hence, we formulate the computation of the unknown label matrix as a smoothing process on the manifold under the constraint that all observations represent an object of one single class. It results into a discrete optimization problem, which can be solved by an efficient and low complexity algorithm. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed graph-based algorithm in the classification of sets of multiple images.

Next, we implement a dimensionality reduction process with simultaneous sparse approximations and subspace projection. It permits to represent each 3D face by only a few spherical functions that are able to capture the salient facial characteristics, and hence to preserve the discriminant facial information. We eventually perform recognition by effective matching in the reduced space, where Linear Discriminant Analysis can be further activated for improved recognition performance.

Therefore, the classifier considers purely appearance-based feature vectors, thus requiring computationally expensive feature extraction or complex probabilistic modelling to achieve satisfactory robustness. In contrast, our approach consists in classifying graphs of keypoints, which incorporates structural information during the classification phase and allows the extraction of simpler feature vectors that are naturally robust.

The proposed model also automatically changes its topology and remains fully compatible with the general framework of deformable models. More precisely, the image space is equipped with a metric that expands salient image details according to their strength and their curvature. During the whole evolution of the model, the sampling of the contour is kept regular with respect to this metric. By this way, the vertex density is reduced along most parts of the curve while a high quality of shape representation is preserved. The complexity of the deformable model is thus improved and is no longer influenced by feature-preserving changes in the resolution of input images. Building the metric requires a prior estimation of contour curvature. It is obtained using a robust estimator which investigates the local variations in the orientation of image gradient. Experimental results on both computer generated and biomedical images are presented to illustrate the advantages of our approach.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

This automated classification method helps us to acquire knowledge about the pattern of defect within a very short period of time and also to decide about the recovery process so that the defected tiles may not be mixed with the fresh tiles.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2571,"Automatic Spatially-Adaptive Balancing of Energy Terms for Image
  Segmentation","Image segmentation techniques are predominately based on parameter-laden optimization. The objective function typically involves weights for balancing competing image fidelity and segmentation regularization cost terms. Setting these weights suitably has been a painstaking, empirical process. Even if such ideal weights are found for a novel image, most current approaches fix the weight across the whole image domain, ignoring the spatially-varying properties of object shape and image appearance. We propose a novel technique that autonomously balances these terms in a spatially-adaptive manner through the incorporation of image reliability in a graph-based segmentation framework. We validate on synthetic data achieving a reduction in mean error of 47% (p-value << 0.05) when compared to the best fixed parameter segmentation. We also present results on medical images (including segmentations of the corpus callosum and brain tissue in MRI data) and on natural images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2572,"Efficient IRIS Recognition through Improvement of Feature Extraction and
  subset Selection",The selection of the optimal feature subset and the classification has become an important issue in the field of iris recognition. In this paper we propose several methods for iris feature subset selection and vector creation. The deterministic feature sequence is extracted from the iris image by using the contourlet transform technique. Contourlet transform captures the intrinsic geometrical structures of iris image. It decomposes the iris image into a set of directional sub-bands with texture details captured in different orientations at various scales so for reducing the feature vector dimensions we use the method for extract only significant bit and information from normalized iris images. In this method we ignore fragile bits. And finally we use SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier for approximating the amount of people identification in our proposed system. Experimental result show that most proposed method reduces processing time and increase the classification accuracy and also the iris feature vector length is much smaller versus the other methods.,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2573,A new approach for digit recognition based on hand gesture analysis,"We present in this paper a new approach for hand gesture analysis that allows digit recognition. The analysis is based on extracting a set of features from a hand image and then combining them by using an induction graph. The most important features we extract from each image are the fingers locations, their heights and the distance between each pair of fingers. Our approach consists of three steps: (i) Hand detection and localization, (ii) fingers extraction and (iii) features identification and combination to digit recognition. Each input image is assumed to contain only one person, thus we apply a fuzzy classifier to identify the skin pixels. In the finger extraction step, we attempt to remove all the hand components except the fingers, this process is based on the hand anatomy properties. The final step consists on representing histogram of the detected fingers in order to extract features that will be used for digit recognition. The approach is invariant to scale, rotation and translation of the hand. Some experiments have been undertaken to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2574,Multi-Label MRF Optimization via Least Squares s-t Cuts,"There are many applications of graph cuts in computer vision, e.g. segmentation. We present a novel method to reformulate the NP-hard, k-way graph partitioning problem as an approximate minimal s-t graph cut problem, for which a globally optimal solution is found in polynomial time. Each non-terminal vertex in the original graph is replaced by a set of ceil(log_2(k)) new vertices. The original graph edges are replaced by new edges connecting the new vertices to each other and to only two, source s and sink t, terminal nodes. The weights of the new edges are obtained using a novel least squares solution approximating the constraints of the initial k-way setup. The minimal s-t cut labels each new vertex with a binary (s vs t) ""Gray"" encoding, which is then decoded into a decimal label number that assigns each of the original vertices to one of k classes. We analyze the properties of the approximation and present quantitative as well as qualitative segmentation results.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

We show that an iterative algorithm which captures the mutual interdependence of orientation flow computation, enhancement and binarization gives very good results on poor quality images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2576,Bounding the Probability of Error for High Precision Recognition,"We consider models for which it is important, early in processing, to estimate some variables with high precision, but perhaps at relatively low rates of recall. If some variables can be identified with near certainty, then they can be conditioned upon, allowing further inference to be done efficiently. Specifically, we consider optical character recognition (OCR) systems that can be bootstrapped by identifying a subset of correctly translated document words with very high precision. This ""clean set"" is subsequently used as document-specific training data. While many current OCR systems produce measures of confidence for the identity of each letter or word, thresholding these confidence values, even at very high values, still produces some errors.   We introduce a novel technique for identifying a set of correct words with very high precision. Rather than estimating posterior probabilities, we bound the probability that any given word is incorrect under very general assumptions, using an approximate worst case analysis. As a result, the parameters of the model are nearly irrelevant, and we are able to identify a subset of words, even in noisy documents, of which we are highly confident. On our set of 10 documents, we are able to identify about 6% of the words on average without making a single error. This ability to produce word lists with very high precision allows us to use a family of models which depends upon such clean word lists.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2577,Augmenting Light Field to model Wave Optics effects,"The ray-based 4D light field representation cannot be directly used to analyze diffractive or phase--sensitive optical elements. In this paper, we exploit tools from wave optics and extend the light field representation via a novel ""light field transform"". We introduce a key modification to the ray--based model to support the transform. We insert a ""virtual light source"", with potentially negative valued radiance for certain emitted rays. We create a look-up table of light field transformers of canonical optical elements. The two key conclusions are that (i) in free space, the 4D light field completely represents wavefront propagation via rays with real (positive as well as negative) valued radiance and (ii) at occluders, a light field composed of light field transformers plus insertion of (ray--based) virtual light sources represents resultant phase and amplitude of wavefronts. For free--space propagation, we analyze different wavefronts and coherence possibilities. For occluders, we show that the light field transform is simply based on a convolution followed by a multiplication operation. This formulation brings powerful concepts from wave optics to computer vision and graphics. We show applications in cubic-phase plate imaging and holographic displays.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  Scale","Medical image registration is a difficult problem. Not only a registration algorithm needs to capture both large and small scale image deformations, it also has to deal with global and local image intensity variations. In this paper we describe a new multiresolution elastic image registration method that challenges these difficulties in image registration. To capture large and small scale image deformations, we use both global and local affine transformation algorithms. To address global and local image intensity variations, we apply an image intensity standardization algorithm to correct image intensity variations. This transforms image intensities into a standard intensity scale, which allows highly accurate registration of medical images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2579,Registration of Standardized Histological Images in Feature Space,"In this paper, we propose three novel and important methods for the registration of histological images for 3D reconstruction. First, possible intensity variations and nonstandardness in images are corrected by an intensity standardization process which maps the image scale into a standard scale where the similar intensities correspond to similar tissues meaning. Second, 2D histological images are mapped into a feature space where continuous variables are used as high confidence image features for accurate registration. Third, we propose an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm that improves reconstruction quality based on both image entropy and mean square error of the registration process. We demonstrate that the choice of reference slice has a significant impact on registration error, standardization, feature space and entropy information. After 2D histological slices are registered through an affine transformation with respect to an automatically chosen reference, the 3D volume is reconstructed by co-registering 2D slices elastically.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

To improve the quality of reconstructed 3D volume, first, intensity variations in images are corrected by an intensity standardization process which maps image intensity scale to a standard scale where similar intensities correspond to similar tissues. Second, a subvolume approach is proposed for 3D reconstruction by dividing standardized slices into groups. Third, in order to improve the quality of the reconstruction process, an automatic best reference slice selection algorithm is developed based on an iterative assessment of image entropy and mean square error of the registration process. Finally, we demonstrate that the choice of the reference slice has a significant impact on registration quality and subsequent 3D reconstruction.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  Feature Extraction","We present BEAMER: a new spatially exploitative approach to learning object detectors which shows excellent results when applied to the task of detecting objects in greyscale aerial imagery in the presence of ambiguous and noisy data. There are four main contributions used to produce these results. First, we introduce a grammar-guided feature extraction system, enabling the exploration of a richer feature space while constraining the features to a useful subset. This is specified with a rule-based generative grammar crafted by a human expert. Second, we learn a classifier on this data using a newly proposed variant of AdaBoost which takes into account the spatially correlated nature of the data. Third, we perform another round of training to optimize the method of converting the pixel classifications generated by boosting into a high quality set of (x, y) locations. Lastly, we carefully define three common problems in object detection and define two evaluation criteria that are tightly matched to these problems. Major strengths of this approach are: (1) a way of randomly searching a broad feature space, (2) its performance when evaluated on well-matched evaluation criteria, and (3) its use of the location prediction domain to learn object detectors as well as to generate detections that perform well on several tasks: object counting, tracking, and target detection. We demonstrate the efficacy of BEAMER with a comprehensive experimental evaluation on a challenging data set.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The face detection technique is based on skin color information and fuzzy classification. A new algorithm is proposed in order to detect automatically face features (eyes, mouth and nose) and extract their correspondent geometrical points. These fiducial points are described by sets of wavelet components which are used for recognition. To achieve the face recognition, we use neural networks and we study its performances for different inputs. We compare the two types of features used for recognition: geometric distances and Gabor coefficients which can be used either independently or jointly. This comparison shows that Gabor coefficients are more powerful than geometric distances. We show with experimental results how the importance recognition ratio makes our system an effective tool for automatic face detection and recognition.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

This method tries to decompose a mixture of subspaces of unlabeled data (queries) into class subspaces as few as possible. Each query is classified into the class whose subspace significantly contributes to the decomposed subspace. Multiple queries from different classes can be simultaneously classified into their respective classes. A practical greedy algorithm of the sparse subspace decomposition is designed for the classification. The present method achieves high recognition rate and robust performance exploiting joint sparsity.,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

In this paper, we have made an attempt to recognize handwritten Farsi characters by using a multilayer perceptron with one hidden layer. The error backpropagation algorithm has been used to train the MLP network. In addition, an analysis has been carried out to determine the number of hidden nodes to achieve high performance of backpropagation network in the recognition of handwritten Farsi characters. The system has been trained using several different forms of handwriting provided by both male and female participants of different age groups. Finally, this rigorous training results an automatic HCR system using MLP network. In this work, the experiments were carried out on two hundred fifty samples of five writers. The results showed that the MLP networks trained by the error backpropagation algorithm are superior in recognition accuracy and memory usage. The result indicates that the backpropagation network provides good recognition accuracy of more than 80% of handwritten Farsi characters.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Approximations of the Bayes factor can be availed of to judge model fit to the data within a given Gaussian mixture model. Between families of Gaussian mixture models, we propose the R\'enyi quadratic entropy as an excellent and tractable model comparison framework. We exemplify this using the segmentation of an MRI image volume, based (1) on a direct Gaussian mixture model applied to the marginal distribution function, and (2) Gaussian model fit through k-means applied to the 4D multivalued image volume furnished by the wavelet transform. Visual preference for one model over another is not immediate.

While the general problem, modeling data by mixtures of manifolds, is very challenging, several approaches exist for modeling data by mixtures of affine subspaces (which is often referred to as hybrid linear modeling). We translate some important instances of multi-manifold modeling to hybrid linear modeling in embedded spaces, without explicitly performing the embedding but applying the kernel trick. The resulting algorithm, Kernel Spectral Curvature Clustering, uses kernels at two levels - both as an implicit embedding method to linearize nonflat manifolds and as a principled method to convert a multiway affinity problem into a spectral clustering one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method by comparing it with other state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic data and a real-world problem of segmenting multiple motions from two perspective camera views.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The candidate characters are extracted by doing connected component analysis on different scale DOG images. In recognition stage, a novel feature vector named accumulated gradient projection vector (AGPV) is used to compare the candidate character with the standard ones. The AGPV is calculated by first projecting pixels of similar gradient orientations onto specific axes, and then accumulates the projected gradient magnitudes by each axis. In the experiments, the AGPVs are proven to be invariant from image scaling and rotation, and robust to noise and illumination change.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2592,"Information tracking approach to segmentation of ultrasound imagery of
  prostate","The size and geometry of the prostate are known to be pivotal quantities used by clinicians to assess the condition of the gland during prostate cancer screening. As an alternative to palpation, an increasing number of methods for estimation of the above-mentioned quantities are based on using imagery data of prostate. The necessity to process large volumes of such data creates a need for automatic segmentation tools which would allow the estimation to be carried out with maximum accuracy and efficiency. In particular, the use of transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) imaging in prostate cancer screening seems to be becoming a standard clinical practice due to the high benefit-to-cost ratio of this imaging modality. Unfortunately, the segmentation of TRUS images is still hampered by relatively low contrast and reduced SNR of the images, thereby requiring the segmentation algorithms to incorporate prior knowledge about the geometry of the gland. In this paper, a novel approach to the problem of segmenting the TRUS images is described. The proposed approach is based on the concept of distribution tracking, which provides a unified framework for modeling and fusing image-related and morphological features of the prostate. Moreover, the same framework allows the segmentation to be regularized via using a new type of ""weak"" shape priors, which minimally bias the estimation procedure, while rendering the latter stable and robust.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2593,Iterative Shrinkage Approach to Restoration of Optical Imagery,"The problem of reconstruction of digital images from their degraded measurements is regarded as a problem of central importance in various fields of engineering and imaging sciences. In such cases, the degradation is typically caused by the resolution limitations of an imaging device in use and/or by the destructive influence of measurement noise. Specifically, when the noise obeys a Poisson probability law, standard approaches to the problem of image reconstruction are based on using fixed-point algorithms which follow the methodology first proposed by Richardson and Lucy. The practice of using these methods, however, shows that their convergence properties tend to deteriorate at relatively high noise levels. Accordingly, in the present paper, a novel method for de-noising and/or de-blurring of digital images corrupted by Poisson noise is introduced. The proposed method is derived under the assumption that the image of interest can be sparsely represented in the domain of a linear transform. Consequently, a shrinkage-based iterative procedure is proposed, which guarantees the solution to converge to the global maximizer of an associated maximum-a-posteriori criterion. It is shown in a series of both computer-simulated and real-life experiments that the proposed method outperforms a number of existing alternatives in terms of stability, precision, and computational efficiency.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

This enables it to work on grayscale images, contrary to most European competitors, which eases robustness to illumination conditions (notably night operation). Speed sign candidates are classified (or rejected) by segmenting potential digits inside them (which is rather original and has several advantages), and then applying a neural digit recognition. The global detection rate is ~90% for both (standard) U.S. and E.U. speed signs, with a misclassification rate <1%, and no validated false alarm in >150 minutes of video.

  Interventional Assistance","Radiofrequency (RF) catheter ablation has transformed treatment for tachyarrhythmias and has become first-line therapy for some tachycardias. The precise localization of the arrhythmogenic site and the positioning of the RF catheter over that site are problematic: they can impair the efficiency of the procedure and are time consuming (several hours). Electroanatomic mapping technologies are available that enable the display of the cardiac chambers and the relative position of ablation lesions. However, these are expensive and use custom-made catheters. The proposed methodology makes use of standard catheters and inexpensive technology in order to create a 3D volume of the heart chamber affected by the arrhythmia. Further, we propose a novel method that uses a priori 3D information of the mapping catheter in order to estimate the 3D locations of multiple electrodes across single view C-arm images.

Grouping images into meaningful categories to reveal useful information is a challenging and important problem. Clustering is a data mining technique to group a set of unsupervised data based on the conceptual clustering principal: maximizing the intraclass similarity and minimizing the interclass similarity.

This calculus evolved in the research field of pure mathematics until 1920, when applied science started to use it. Only recently, fractional calculus was involved in image processing methods. As we shall see, the fractional calculation is able to enhance the quality of images, with interesting possibilities in edge detection and image restoration.

2598,Behavior Subtraction,"Background subtraction has been a driving engine for many computer vision and video analytics tasks. Although its many variants exist, they all share the underlying assumption that photometric scene properties are either static or exhibit temporal stationarity. While this works in some applications, the model fails when one is interested in discovering {\it changes in scene dynamics} rather than those in a static background; detection of unusual pedestrian and motor traffic patterns is but one example. We propose a new model and computational framework that address this failure by considering stationary scene dynamics as a ``background'' with which observed scene dynamics are compared. Central to our approach is the concept of an {\it event}, that we define as short-term scene dynamics captured over a time window at a specific spatial location in the camera field of view. We compute events by time-aggregating motion labels, obtained by background subtraction, as well as object descriptors (e.g., object size). Subsequently, we characterize events probabilistically, but use a low-memory, low-complexity surrogates in practical implementation. Using these surrogates amounts to {\it behavior subtraction}, a new algorithm with some surprising properties. As demonstrated here, behavior subtraction is an effective tool in anomaly detection and localization. It is resilient to spurious background motion, such as one due to camera jitter, and is content-blind, i.e., it works equally well on humans, cars, animals, and other objects in both uncluttered and highly-cluttered scenes. Clearly, treating video as a collection of events rather than colored pixels opens new possibilities for video analytics.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

A recently devised $p$-adic hierarchical classification algorithm imitating the known LBG quantisation method classifies the solutions for all the samples after having determined the number of clusters using the known intra-inter validity of clusterings.

2600,An Iterative Shrinkage Approach to Total-Variation Image Restoration,"The problem of restoration of digital images from their degraded measurements plays a central role in a multitude of practically important applications. A particularly challenging instance of this problem occurs in the case when the degradation phenomenon is modeled by an ill-conditioned operator. In such a case, the presence of noise makes it impossible to recover a valuable approximation of the image of interest without using some a priori information about its properties. Such a priori information is essential for image restoration, rendering it stable and robust to noise. Particularly, if the original image is known to be a piecewise smooth function, one of the standard priors used in this case is defined by the Rudin-Osher-Fatemi model, which results in total variation (TV) based image restoration. The current arsenal of algorithms for TV-based image restoration is vast. In the present paper, a different approach to the solution of the problem is proposed based on the method of iterative shrinkage (aka iterated thresholding). In the proposed method, the TV-based image restoration is performed through a recursive application of two simple procedures, viz. linear filtering and soft thresholding. Therefore, the method can be identified as belonging to the group of first-order algorithms which are efficient in dealing with images of relatively large sizes. Another valuable feature of the proposed method consists in its working directly with the TV functional, rather then with its smoothed versions. Moreover, the method provides a single solution for both isotropic and anisotropic definitions of the TV functional, thereby establishing a useful connection between the two formulae.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  Transformation Combined With Wavelet Filters",A new fangled method for ship wake detection in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is explored here. Most of the detection procedure applies the Radon transform as its properties outfit more than any other transformation for the detection purpose. But still it holds problems when the transform is applied to an image with a high level of noise. Here this paper articulates the combination between the radon transformation and the shrinkage methods which increase the mode of wake detection process. The latter shrinkage method with RT maximize the signal to noise ratio hence it leads to most optimal detection of lines in the SAR images. The originality mainly works on the denoising segment of the proposed algorithm. Experimental work outs are carried over both in simulated and real SAR images. The detection process is more adequate with the proposed method and improves better than the conventional methods.,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2604,Pigment Melanin: Pattern for Iris Recognition,"Recognition of iris based on Visible Light (VL) imaging is a difficult problem because of the light reflection from the cornea. Nonetheless, pigment melanin provides a rich feature source in VL, unavailable in Near-Infrared (NIR) imaging. This is due to biological spectroscopy of eumelanin, a chemical not stimulated in NIR. In this case, a plausible solution to observe such patterns may be provided by an adaptive procedure using a variational technique on the image histogram. To describe the patterns, a shape analysis method is used to derive feature-code for each subject. An important question is how much the melanin patterns, extracted from VL, are independent of iris texture in NIR. With this question in mind, the present investigation proposes fusion of features extracted from NIR and VL to boost the recognition performance. We have collected our own database (UTIRIS) consisting of both NIR and VL images of 158 eyes of 79 individuals. This investigation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm is highly sensitive to the patterns of cromophores and improves the iris recognition rate.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

We propose several heuristic algorithms to minimize possible errors introduced by prevalent nonperfect orthogonal condition and noncoherent luminance. In our approach, we first extract the 2D features that are visible to both cameras in both views. Then, we estimate the coordinates of the features in the hidden profile view based on the visible features extracted in the two orthogonal views. Finally, based on the coordinates of the extracted features, we deform a 3D generic model to perform the desired 3D clone modeling. Present study proves the scope of resulted facial models for practical applications like face recognition and facial animation.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2606,Automatic creation of urban velocity fields from aerial video,"In this paper, we present a system for modelling vehicle motion in an urban scene from low frame-rate aerial video. In particular, the scene is modelled as a probability distribution over velocities at every pixel in the image.   We describe the complete system for acquiring this model. The video is captured from a helicopter and stabilized by warping the images to match an orthorectified image of the area. A pixel classifier is applied to the stabilized images, and the response is segmented to determine car locations and orientations. The results are fed in to a tracking scheme which tracks cars for three frames, creating tracklets. This allows the tracker to use a combination of velocity, direction, appearance, and acceleration cues to keep only tracks likely to be correct. Each tracklet provides a measurement of the car velocity at every point along the tracklet's length, and these are then aggregated to create a histogram of vehicle velocities at every pixel in the image.   The results demonstrate that the velocity probability distribution prior can be used to infer a variety of information about road lane directions, speed limits, vehicle speeds and common trajectories, and traffic bottlenecks, as well as providing a means of describing environmental knowledge about traffic rules that can be used in tracking.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

To do this, we present a method for identifying ellipses and their properties quickly and reliably with a novel technique that exploits intensity differences between objects and a geometric technique for matching an ellipse in 2d to a circle in 3d.   We apply these techniques to the specific problem of determining the pose and location of vehicles, particularly cars, from a single image. We have achieved excellent pose recovery performance on artificially generated car images and show promising results on real vehicle images. We also make use of the ellipse detection method to identify car wheels from images, with a very high successful match rate.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2608,A Novel Feature Extraction for Robust EMG Pattern Recognition,"Varieties of noises are major problem in recognition of Electromyography (EMG) signal. Hence, methods to remove noise become most significant in EMG signal analysis. White Gaussian noise (WGN) is used to represent interference in this paper. Generally, WGN is difficult to be removed using typical filtering and solutions to remove WGN are limited. In addition, noise removal is an important step before performing feature extraction, which is used in EMG-based recognition. This research is aimed to present a novel feature that tolerate with WGN. As a result, noise removal algorithm is not needed. Two novel mean and median frequencies (MMNF and MMDF) are presented for robust feature extraction. Sixteen existing features and two novelties are evaluated in a noisy environment. WGN with various signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), i.e. 20-0 dB, was added to the original EMG signal. The results showed that MMNF performed very well especially in weak EMG signal compared with others. The error of MMNF in weak EMG signal with very high noise, 0 dB SNR, is about 5-10 percent and closed by MMDF and Histogram, whereas the error of other features is more than 20 percent. While in strong EMG signal, the error of MMNF is better than those from other features. Moreover, the combination of MMNF, Histrogram of EMG and Willison amplitude is used as feature vector in classification task. The experimental result shows the better recognition result in noisy environment than other success feature candidates. From the above results demonstrate that MMNF can be used for new robust feature extraction.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2610,Accelerating Competitive Learning Graph Quantization,"Vector quantization(VQ) is a lossy data compression technique from signal processing for which simple competitive learning is one standard method to quantize patterns from the input space. Extending competitive learning VQ to the domain of graphs results in competitive learning for quantizing input graphs. In this contribution, we propose an accelerated version of competitive learning graph quantization (GQ) without trading computational time against solution quality. For this, we lift graphs locally to vectors in order to avoid unnecessary calculations of intractable graph distances. In doing so, the accelerated version of competitive learning GQ gradually turns locally into a competitive learning VQ with increasing number of iterations. Empirical results show a significant speedup by maintaining a comparable solution quality.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2611,Boosting k-NN for categorization of natural scenes,"The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) classification rule has proven extremely successful in countless many computer vision applications. For example, image categorization often relies on uniform voting among the nearest prototypes in the space of descriptors. In spite of its good properties, the classic k-NN rule suffers from high variance when dealing with sparse prototype datasets in high dimensions. A few techniques have been proposed to improve k-NN classification, which rely on either deforming the nearest neighborhood relationship or modifying the input space. In this paper, we propose a novel boosting algorithm, called UNN (Universal Nearest Neighbors), which induces leveraged k-NN, thus generalizing the classic k-NN rule. We redefine the voting rule as a strong classifier that linearly combines predictions from the k closest prototypes. Weak classifiers are learned by UNN so as to minimize a surrogate risk. A major feature of UNN is the ability to learn which prototypes are the most relevant for a given class, thus allowing one for effective data reduction. Experimental results on the synthetic two-class dataset of Ripley show that such a filtering strategy is able to reject ""noisy"" prototypes. We carried out image categorization experiments on a database containing eight classes of natural scenes. We show that our method outperforms significantly the classic k-NN classification, while enabling significant reduction of the computational cost by means of data filtering.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  recognition system using isotropic filter","The need of sign language is increasing radically especially to hearing impaired community. Only few research groups try to automatically recognize sign language from video, colored gloves and etc. Their approach requires a valid segmentation of the data that is used for training and of the data that is used to be recognized. Recognition of a sign language image sequence is challenging because of the variety of hand shapes and hand motions. Here, this paper proposes to apply a combination of image segmentation with restoration using topological derivatives for achieving high recognition accuracy. Image quality measures are conceded here to differentiate the methods both subjectively as well as objectively. Experiments show that the additional use of the restoration before segmenting the postures significantly improves the correct rate of hand detection, and that the discrete derivatives yields a high rate of discrimination between different static hand postures as well as between hand postures and the scene background. Eventually, the research is to contribute to the implementation of automated sign language recognition system mainly established for the welfare purpose.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The additional capability of tracking in realtime - with minimal latency - opens up the experimental possibility of manipulating sensory feedback, thus allowing detailed explorations of the neural basis for control of behavior. Here we describe a new system capable of tracking the position and body orientation of animals such as flies and birds. The system operates with less than 40 msec latency and can track multiple animals simultaneously. To achieve these results, a multi target tracking algorithm was developed based on the Extended Kalman Filter and the Nearest Neighbor Standard Filter data association algorithm. In one implementation, an eleven camera system is capable of tracking three flies simultaneously at 60 frames per second using a gigabit network of nine standard Intel Pentium 4 and Core 2 Duo computers. This manuscript presents the rationale and details of the algorithms employed and shows three implementations of the system. An experiment was performed using the tracking system to measure the effect of visual contrast on the flight speed of Drosophila melanogaster. At low contrasts, speed is more variable and faster on average than at high contrasts. Thus, the system is already a useful tool to study the neurobiology and behavior of freely flying animals. If combined with other techniques, such as `virtual reality'-type computer graphics or genetic manipulation, the tracking system would offer a powerful new way to investigate the biology of flying animals.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2622,The Influence of Intensity Standardization on Medical Image Registration,"Acquisition-to-acquisition signal intensity variations (non-standardness) are inherent in MR images. Standardization is a post processing method for correcting inter-subject intensity variations through transforming all images from the given image gray scale into a standard gray scale wherein similar intensities achieve similar tissue meanings. The lack of a standard image intensity scale in MRI leads to many difficulties in tissue characterizability, image display, and analysis, including image segmentation. This phenomenon has been documented well; however, effects of standardization on medical image registration have not been studied yet. In this paper, we investigate the influence of intensity standardization in registration tasks with systematic and analytic evaluations involving clinical MR images. We conducted nearly 20,000 clinical MR image registration experiments and evaluated the quality of registrations both quantitatively and qualitatively. The evaluations show that intensity variations between images degrades the accuracy of registration performance. The results imply that the accuracy of image registration not only depends on spatial and geometric similarity but also on the similarity of the intensity values for the same tissues in different images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  Images","This paper investigates, using prior shape models and the concept of ball scale (b-scale), ways of automatically recognizing objects in 3D images without performing elaborate searches or optimization. That is, the goal is to place the model in a single shot close to the right pose (position, orientation, and scale) in a given image so that the model boundaries fall in the close vicinity of object boundaries in the image. This is achieved via the following set of key ideas: (a) A semi-automatic way of constructing a multi-object shape model assembly. (b) A novel strategy of encoding, via b-scale, the pose relationship between objects in the training images and their intensity patterns captured in b-scale images. (c) A hierarchical mechanism of positioning the model, in a one-shot way, in a given image from a knowledge of the learnt pose relationship and the b-scale image of the given image to be segmented. The evaluation results on a set of 20 routine clinical abdominal female and male CT data sets indicate the following: (1) Incorporating a large number of objects improves the recognition accuracy dramatically. (2) The recognition algorithm can be thought as a hierarchical framework such that quick replacement of the model assembly is defined as coarse recognition and delineation itself is known as finest recognition. (3) Scale yields useful information about the relationship between the model assembly and any given image such that the recognition results in a placement of the model close to the actual pose without doing any elaborate searches or optimization.

2634,Nonlinear Filter Based Image Denoising Using AMF Approach,"This paper proposes a new technique based on nonlinear Adaptive Median filter (AMF) for image restoration. Image denoising is a common procedure in digital image processing aiming at the removal of noise, which may corrupt an image during its acquisition or transmission, while retaining its quality. This procedure is traditionally performed in the spatial or frequency domain by filtering. The aim of image enhancement is to reconstruct the true image from the corrupted image. The process of image acquisition frequently leads to degradation and the quality of the digitized image becomes inferior to the original image. Filtering is a technique for enhancing the image. Linear filter is the filtering in which the value of an output pixel is a linear combination of neighborhood values, which can produce blur in the image. Thus a variety of smoothing techniques have been developed that are non linear. Median filter is the one of the most popular non-linear filter. When considering a small neighborhood it is highly efficient but for large window and in case of high noise it gives rise to more blurring to image. The Centre Weighted Median (CWM) filter has got a better average performance over the median filter [8]. However the original pixel corrupted and noise reduction is substantial under high noise condition. Hence this technique has also blurring affect on the image. To illustrate the superiority of the proposed approach by overcoming the existing problem, the proposed new scheme (AMF) Adaptive Median Filter has been simulated along with the standard ones and various performance measures have been compared.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

This is mainly due to that the effectiveness of clinical diagnosis using CT image lies on the image quality. The denoising technique for CT images using window-based Multi-wavelet transformation and thresholding shows the effectiveness in denoising, however, a drawback exists in selecting the closer windows in the process of window-based multi-wavelet transformation and thresholding. Generally, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are closer to each window of original noisy image are obtained by the checking them sequentially. This leads to the possibility of missing out very closer windows and so enhancement is required in the aforesaid process of the denoising technique. In this paper, we propose a GA-based window selection methodology to include the denoising technique. With the aid of the GA-based window selection methodology, the windows of the duplicate noisy image that are very closer to every window of the original noisy image are extracted in an effective manner. By incorporating the proposed GA-based window selection methodology, the denoising the CT image is performed effectively.

Setting threshold parameters is one of the most important issues when dealing with such applications, as they affect both the computability, which is outlined by the support map, and the appearance of the coherence length diagram itself and of defect maps.

2648,Robust multi-camera view face recognition,"This paper presents multi-appearance fusion of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and generalization of Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) for multi-camera view offline face recognition (verification) system. The generalization of LDA has been extended to establish correlations between the face classes in the transformed representation and this is called canonical covariate. The proposed system uses Gabor filter banks for characterization of facial features by spatial frequency, spatial locality and orientation to make compensate to the variations of face instances occurred due to illumination, pose and facial expression changes. Convolution of Gabor filter bank to face images produces Gabor face representations with high dimensional feature vectors. PCA and canonical covariate are then applied on the Gabor face representations to reduce the high dimensional feature spaces into low dimensional Gabor eigenfaces and Gabor canonical faces. Reduced eigenface vector and canonical face vector are fused together using weighted mean fusion rule. Finally, support vector machines (SVM) have trained with augmented fused set of features and perform the recognition task. The system has been evaluated with UMIST face database consisting of multiview faces. The experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed system for multi-view face images with high recognition rates. Complexity analysis of the proposed system is also presented at the end of the experimental results.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2657,"Regularized Richardson-Lucy Algorithm for Sparse Reconstruction of
  Poissonian Images","Restoration of digital images from their degraded measurements has always been a problem of great theoretical and practical importance in numerous applications of imaging sciences. A specific solution to the problem of image restoration is generally determined by the nature of degradation phenomenon as well as by the statistical properties of measurement noises. The present study is concerned with the case in which the images of interest are corrupted by convolutional blurs and Poisson noises. To deal with such problems, there exists a range of solution methods which are based on the principles originating from the fixed-point algorithm of Richardson and Lucy (RL). In this paper, we provide conceptual and experimental proof that such methods tend to converge to sparse solutions, which makes them applicable only to those images which can be represented by a relatively small number of non-zero samples in the spatial domain. Unfortunately, the set of such images is relatively small, which restricts the applicability of RL-type methods. On the other hand, virtually all practical images admit sparse representations in the domain of a properly designed linear transform. To take advantage of this fact, it is therefore tempting to modify the RL algorithm so as to make it recover representation coefficients, rather than the values of their associated image. Such modification is introduced in this paper. Apart from the generality of its assumptions, the proposed method is also superior to many established reconstruction approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and computational complexity. This and other conclusions of this study are validated through a series of numerical experiments.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2660,"A New Approach to Lung Image Segmentation using Fuzzy Possibilistic
  C-Means Algorithm","Image segmentation is a vital part of image processing. Segmentation has its application widespread in the field of medical images in order to diagnose curious diseases. The same medical images can be segmented manually. But the accuracy of image segmentation using the segmentation algorithms is more when compared with the manual segmentation. In the field of medical diagnosis an extensive diversity of imaging techniques is presently available, such as radiography, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Medical image segmentation is an essential step for most consequent image analysis tasks. Although the original FCM algorithm yields good results for segmenting noise free images, it fails to segment images corrupted by noise, outliers and other imaging artifact. This paper presents an image segmentation approach using Modified Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm and Fuzzy Possibilistic c-means algorithm (FPCM). This approach is a generalized version of standard Fuzzy CMeans Clustering (FCM) algorithm. The limitation of the conventional FCM technique is eliminated in modifying the standard technique. The Modified FCM algorithm is formulated by modifying the distance measurement of the standard FCM algorithm to permit the labeling of a pixel to be influenced by other pixels and to restrain the noise effect during segmentation. Instead of having one term in the objective function, a second term is included, forcing the membership to be as high as possible without a maximum limit constraint of one. Experiments are conducted on real images to investigate the performance of the proposed modified FCM technique in segmenting the medical images. Standard FCM, Modified FCM, Fuzzy Possibilistic CMeans algorithm (FPCM) are compared to explore the accuracy of our proposed approach.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Partitioning around medoids (PAM) algorithm is used to partition the set of n invariant feature points of the face and palmprint images into k clusters. By partitioning the face and palmprint images with scale invariant features SIFT points, a number of clusters is formed on both the images. Then on each cluster, an isomorphic graph is drawn. In the next step, the most probable pair of graphs is searched using iterative relaxation algorithm from all possible isomorphic graphs for a pair of corresponding face and palmprint images. Finally, graphs are fused by pairing the isomorphic graphs into augmented groups in terms of addition of invariant SIFT points and in terms of combining pair of keypoint descriptors by concatenation rule.

2663,Offline Handwriting Recognition using Genetic Algorithm,"Handwriting Recognition enables a person to scribble something on a piece of paper and then convert it into text. If we look into the practical reality there are enumerable styles in which a character may be written. These styles can be self combined to generate more styles. Even if a small child knows the basic styles a character can be written, he would be able to recognize characters written in styles intermediate between them or formed by their mixture. This motivates the use of Genetic Algorithms for the problem. In order to prove this, we made a pool of images of characters. We converted them to graphs. The graph of every character was intermixed to generate styles intermediate between the styles of parent character. Character recognition involved the matching of the graph generated from the unknown character image with the graphs generated by mixing.

The result of the compression changes as per the basis and tap of the wavelet used. It is proposed that proper selection of mother wavelet on the basis of nature of images, improve the quality as well as compression ratio remarkably. We suggest the novel technique, which is based on wavelet packet best tree based on Threshold Entropy with enhanced run-length encoding. This method reduces the time complexity of wavelet packets decomposition as complete tree is not decomposed. Our algorithm selects the sub-bands, which include significant information based on threshold entropy. The enhanced run length encoding technique is suggested provides better results than RLE.

  MRFs","We numerically investigate a mean-field Bayesian approach with the assistance of the Markov chain Monte Carlo method to estimate motion velocity fields and probabilistic models simultaneously in consecutive digital images described by spatio-temporal Markov random fields. Preliminary to construction of our procedure, we find that mean-field variables in the iteration diverge due to improper normalization factor of regularization terms appearing in the posterior. To avoid this difficulty, we rescale the regularization term by introducing a scaling factor and optimizing it by means of minimization of the mean-square error. We confirm that the optimal scaling factor stabilizes the mean-field iterative process of the motion velocity estimation. We next attempt to estimate the optimal values of hyper-parameters including the regularization term, which define our probabilistic model macroscopically, by using the Boltzmann-machine type learning algorithm based on gradient descent of marginal likelihood (type-II likelihood) with respect to the hyper-parameters. In our framework, one can estimate both the probabilistic model (hyper-parameters) and motion velocity fields simultaneously. We find that our motion estimation is much better than the result obtained by Zhang and Hanouer (1995) in which the hyper-parameters are set to some ad-hoc values without any theoretical justification.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The problem of nearest neighbor search is handled by a variant of the locality sensitive hashing (LSH) scheme. The novelty of our work lies in the speed up achieved by the hashing scheme and the robustness and inherent modularity and parallel structure achieved by the LLE setup.

Using these zones, we construct a triplet set of zones i.e. three zones: In/Out zone (zone where an object can enter or exit the scene), 'lost zone' and 'found zone'. Thanks to these triplets, during the testing phase, we can repair the erroneous trajectories according to which triplet they are most likely to belong to.

However, a major disadvantage of the technique is that it is extremely slow during training for larger classes and hence not suitable for real-time complex problems such as pattern recognition. This is an attempt to develop a parallel framework for the training algorithm of a perceptron. In this paper, two general architectures for a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) have been demonstrated. The first architecture is All-Class-in-One-Network (ACON) where all the classes are placed in a single network and the second one is One-Class-in-One-Network (OCON) where an individual single network is responsible for each and every class. Capabilities of these two architectures were compared and verified in solving human face recognition, which is a complex pattern recognition task where several factors affect the recognition performance like pose variations, facial expression changes, occlusions, and most importantly illumination changes. Both the structures were implemented and tested for face recognition purpose and experimental results show that the OCON structure performs better than the generally used ACON ones in term of training convergence speed of the network. Unlike the conventional sequential approach of training the neural networks, the OCON technique may be implemented by training all the classes of the face images simultaneously.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

In case of ORL face database, recognition rate for visual face images is 89.5% and that is increased to 97.5% for log-polar-visual face images whereas for OTCBVS face database recognition rate for visual images is 87.84% and 96.36% for log-polar-visual face images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2684,Human Face Recognition using Line Features,"In this work we investigate a novel approach to handle the challenges of face recognition, which includes rotation, scale, occlusion, illumination etc. Here, we have used thermal face images as those are capable to minimize the affect of illumination changes and occlusion due to moustache, beards, adornments etc. The proposed approach registers the training and testing thermal face images in polar coordinate, which is capable to handle complicacies introduced by scaling and rotation. Line features are extracted from thermal polar images and feature vectors are constructed using these line. Feature vectors thus obtained passes through principal component analysis (PCA) for the dimensionality reduction of feature vectors. Finally, the images projected into eigenspace are classified using a multi-layer perceptron. In the experiments we have used Object Tracking and Classification Beyond Visible Spectrum (OTCBVS) database. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improves the verification and identification performance and the success rate is 99.25%.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2686,Registration of Brain Images using Fast Walsh Hadamard Transform,"A lot of image registration techniques have been developed with great significance for data analysis in medicine, astrophotography, satellite imaging and few other areas. This work proposes a method for medical image registration using Fast Walsh Hadamard transform. This algorithm registers images of the same or different modalities. Each image bit is lengthened in terms of Fast Walsh Hadamard basis functions. Each basis function is a notion of determining various aspects of local structure, e.g., horizontal edge, corner, etc. These coefficients are normalized and used as numerals in a chosen number system which allows one to form a unique number for each type of local structure. The experimental results show that Fast Walsh Hadamard transform accomplished better results than the conventional Walsh transform in the time domain. Also Fast Walsh Hadamard transform is more reliable in medical image registration consuming less time.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2687,"Multi-environment model estimation for motility analysis of
  Caenorhabditis Elegans","The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is a well-known model organism used to investigate fundamental questions in biology. Motility assays of this small roundworm are designed to study the relationships between genes and behavior. Commonly, motility analysis is used to classify nematode movements and characterize them quantitatively. Over the past years, C. elegans' motility has been studied across a wide range of environments, including crawling on substrates, swimming in fluids, and locomoting through microfluidic substrates. However, each environment often requires customized image processing tools relying on heuristic parameter tuning. In the present study, we propose a novel Multi-Environment Model Estimation (MEME) framework for automated image segmentation that is versatile across various environments. The MEME platform is constructed around the concept of Mixture of Gaussian (MOG) models, where statistical models for both the background environment and the nematode appearance are explicitly learned and used to accurately segment a target nematode. Our method is designed to simplify the burden often imposed on users; here, only a single image which includes a nematode in its environment must be provided for model learning. In addition, our platform enables the extraction of nematode `skeletons' for straightforward motility quantification. We test our algorithm on various locomotive environments and compare performances with an intensity-based thresholding method. Overall, MEME outperforms the threshold-based approach for the overwhelming majority of cases examined. Ultimately, MEME provides researchers with an attractive platform for C. elegans' segmentation and `skeletonizing' across a wide range of motility assays.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2688,"Improved RANSAC performance using simple, iterative minimal-set solvers","RANSAC is a popular technique for estimating model parameters in the presence of outliers. The best speed is achieved when the minimum possible number of points is used to estimate hypotheses for the model. Many useful problems can be represented using polynomial constraints (for instance, the determinant of a fundamental matrix must be zero) and so have a number of solutions which are consistent with a minimal set. A considerable amount of effort has been expended on finding the constraints of such problems, and these often require the solution of systems of polynomial equations. We show that better performance can be achieved by using a simple optimization based approach on minimal sets. For a given minimal set, the optimization approach is not guaranteed to converge to the correct solution. However, when used within RANSAC the greater speed and numerical stability results in better performance overall, and much simpler algorithms. We also show that by selecting more than the minimal number of points and using robust optimization can yield better results for very noisy by reducing the number of trials required. The increased speed of our method demonstrated with experiments on essential matrix estimation.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Since the patch itself plays a significant role in optimizing detection performance, a study on the influence of patch size and shape is carried out. The optimum patch size and shape is determined using the proposed method. Usually, template matching is also combined with other methods in order to improve detection accuracy. Thus, in this paper, the effectiveness of two image processing methods i.e. grayscale and Haar wavelet transform, when used with template matching are analyzed.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2690,Neural Network Based Reconstruction of a 3D Object from a 2D Wireframe,"We propose a new approach for constructing a 3D representation from a 2D wireframe drawing. A drawing is simply a parallel projection of a 3D object onto a 2D surface; humans are able to recreate mental 3D models from 2D representations very easily, yet the process is very difficult to emulate computationally. We hypothesize that our ability to perform this construction relies on the angles in the 2D scene, among other geometric properties. Being able to reproduce this reconstruction process automatically would allow for efficient and robust 3D sketch interfaces. Our research focuses on the relationship between 2D geometry observable in the sketch and 3D geometry derived from a potential 3D construction. We present a fully automated system that constructs 3D representations from 2D wireframes using a neural network in conjunction with a genetic search algorithm.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2691,Video Event Recognition for Surveillance Applications (VERSA),"VERSA provides a general-purpose framework for defining and recognizing events in live or recorded surveillance video streams. The approach for event recognition in VERSA is using a declarative logic language to define the spatial and temporal relationships that characterize a given event or activity. Doing so requires the definition of certain fundamental spatial and temporal relationships and a high-level syntax for specifying frame templates and query parameters. Although the handling of uncertainty in the current VERSA implementation is simplistic, the language and architecture is amenable to extending using Fuzzy Logic or similar approaches. VERSA's high-level architecture is designed to work in XML-based, services- oriented environments. VERSA can be thought of as subscribing to the XML annotations streamed by a lower-level video analytics service that provides basic entity detection, labeling, and tracking. One or many VERSA Event Monitors could thus analyze video streams and provide alerts when certain events are detected.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2692,"Ear Identification by Fusion of Segmented Slice Regions using Invariant
  Features: An Experimental Manifold with Dual Fusion Approach","This paper proposes a robust ear identification system which is developed by fusing SIFT features of color segmented slice regions of an ear. The proposed ear identification method makes use of Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to build ear model with mixture of Gaussian using vector quantization algorithm and K-L divergence is applied to the GMM framework for recording the color similarity in the specified ranges by comparing color similarity between a pair of reference ear and probe ear. SIFT features are then detected and extracted from each color slice region as a part of invariant feature extraction. The extracted keypoints are then fused separately by the two fusion approaches, namely concatenation and the Dempster-Shafer theory. Finally, the fusion approaches generate two independent augmented feature vectors which are used for identification of individuals separately. The proposed identification technique is tested on IIT Kanpur ear database of 400 individuals and is found to achieve 98.25% accuracy for identification while top 5 matched criteria is set for each subject.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2694,Biometric Authentication using Nonparametric Methods,"The physiological and behavioral trait is employed to develop biometric authentication systems. The proposed work deals with the authentication of iris and signature based on minimum variance criteria. The iris patterns are preprocessed based on area of the connected components. The segmented image used for authentication consists of the region with large variations in the gray level values. The image region is split into quadtree components. The components with minimum variance are determined from the training samples. Hu moments are applied on the components. The summation of moment values corresponding to minimum variance components are provided as input vector to k-means and fuzzy k-means classifiers. The best performance was obtained for MMU database consisting of 45 subjects. The number of subjects with zero False Rejection Rate [FRR] was 44 and number of subjects with zero False Acceptance Rate [FAR] was 45. This paper addresses the computational load reduction in off-line signature verification based on minimal features using k-means, fuzzy k-means, k-nn, fuzzy k-nn and novel average-max approaches. FRR of 8.13% and FAR of 10% was achieved using k-nn classifier. The signature is a biometric, where variations in a genuine case, is a natural expectation. In the genuine signature, certain parts of signature vary from one instance to another.

2696,Optimally Training a Cascade Classifier,"Cascade classifiers are widely used in real-time object detection. Different from conventional classifiers that are designed for a low overall classification error rate, a classifier in each node of the cascade is required to achieve an extremely high detection rate and moderate false positive rate. Although there are a few reported methods addressing this requirement in the context of object detection, there is no a principled feature selection method that explicitly takes into account this asymmetric node learning objective. We provide such an algorithm here. We show a special case of the biased minimax probability machine has the same formulation as the linear asymmetric classifier (LAC) of \cite{wu2005linear}. We then design a new boosting algorithm that directly optimizes the cost function of LAC. The resulting totally-corrective boosting algorithm is implemented by the column generation technique in convex optimization. Experimental results on object detection verify the effectiveness of the proposed boosting algorithm as a node classifier in cascade object detection, and show performance better than that of the current state-of-the-art.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2697,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) allows the automatic
  identification of follicles in microscopic images of human ovarian tissue","Human ovarian reserve is defined by the population of nongrowing follicles (NGFs) in the ovary. Direct estimation of ovarian reserve involves the identification of NGFs in prepared ovarian tissue. Previous studies involving human tissue have used hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stain, with NGF populations estimated by human examination either of tissue under a microscope, or of images taken of this tissue. In this study we replaced HE with proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and automated the identification and enumeration of NGFs that appear in the resulting microscopic images. We compared the automated estimates to those obtained by human experts, with the ""gold standard"" taken to be the average of the conservative and liberal estimates by three human experts. The automated estimates were within 10% of the ""gold standard"", for images at both 100x and 200x magnifications. Automated analysis took longer than human analysis for several hundred images, not allowing for breaks from analysis needed by humans. Our results both replicate and improve on those of previous studies involving rodent ovaries, and demonstrate the viability of large-scale studies of human ovarian reserve using a combination of immunohistochemistry and computational image analysis techniques.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Although there are several intensity invariant approaches to skin detection, the skin color of Indian sub-continentals have not been focused separately. The approach of this research is to make a comparative study between three image segmentation approaches using Indian sub-continental human images, to optimize the detection criteria, and to find some efficient parameters to detect the skin area from these images. The experiments observed that HSV color model based approach to Indian sub-continental skin detection is more suitable with considerable success rate of 91.1% true positives and 88.1% true negatives.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2699,Weighted Attribute Fusion Model for Face Recognition,"Recognizing a face based on its attributes is an easy task for a human to perform as it is a cognitive process. In recent years, Face Recognition is achieved with different kinds of facial features which were used separately or in a combined manner. Currently, Feature fusion methods and parallel methods are the facial features used and performed by integrating multiple feature sets at different levels. However, this integration and the combinational methods do not guarantee better result. Hence to achieve better results, the feature fusion model with multiple weighted facial attribute set is selected. For this feature model, face images from predefined data set has been taken from Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) and applied on different methods like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based Eigen feature extraction technique, Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) based feature extraction technique, Histogram Based Feature Extraction technique and Simple Intensity based features. The extracted feature set obtained from these methods were compared and tested for accuracy. In this work we have developed a model which will use the above set of feature extraction techniques with different levels of weights to attain better accuracy. The results show that the selection of optimum weight for a particular feature will lead to improvement in recognition rate.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  Binary/Trinary Patterns","Accurately detecting pedestrians in images plays a critically important role in many computer vision applications. Extraction of effective features is the key to this task. Promising features should be discriminative, robust to various variations and easy to compute. In this work, we present novel features, termed dense center-symmetric local binary patterns (CS-LBP) and pyramid center-symmetric local binary/ternary patterns (CS-LBP/LTP), for pedestrian detection. The standard LBP proposed by Ojala et al. \cite{c4} mainly captures the texture information. The proposed CS-LBP feature, in contrast, captures the gradient information and some texture information. Moreover, the proposed dense CS-LBP and the pyramid CS-LBP/LTP are easy to implement and computationally efficient, which is desirable for real-time applications. Experiments on the INRIA pedestrian dataset show that the dense CS-LBP feature with linear supporct vector machines (SVMs) is comparable with the histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) feature with linear SVMs, and the pyramid CS-LBP/LTP features outperform both HOG features with linear SVMs and the start-of-the-art pyramid HOG (PHOG) feature with the histogram intersection kernel SVMs. We also demonstrate that the combination of our pyramid CS-LBP feature and the PHOG feature could significantly improve the detection performance-producing state-of-the-art accuracy on the INRIA pedestrian dataset.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

One of the most important features for the diagnosis of melanoma in dermoscopy images is the blue-white veil (irregular, structureless areas of confluent blue pigmentation with an overlying white ""ground-glass"" film). In this article, we present a machine learning approach to the detection of blue-white veil and related structures in dermoscopy images. The method involves contextual pixel classification using a decision tree classifier.

Due to the difficulty and subjectivity of human interpretation, dermoscopy image analysis has become an important research area. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is the automated detection of lesion borders. Although numerous methods have been developed for the detection of lesion borders, very few studies were comprehensive in the evaluation of their results. Methods: In this paper, we evaluate five recent border detection methods on a set of 90 dermoscopy images using three sets of dermatologist-drawn borders as the ground-truth. In contrast to previous work, we utilize an objective measure, the Normalized Probabilistic Rand Index, which takes into account the variations in the ground-truth images.

2710,"Evolutionary Computational Method of Facial Expression Analysis for
  Content-based Video Retrieval using 2-Dimensional Cellular Automata","In this paper, Deterministic Cellular Automata (DCA) based video shot classification and retrieval is proposed. The deterministic 2D Cellular automata model captures the human facial expressions, both spontaneous and posed. The determinism stems from the fact that the facial muscle actions are standardized by the encodings of Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and Action Units (AUs). Based on these encodings, we generate the set of evolutionary update rules of the DCA for each facial expression. We consider a Person-Independent Facial Expression Space (PIFES) to analyze the facial expressions based on Partitioned 2D-Cellular Automata which capture the dynamics of facial expressions and classify the shots based on it. Target video shot is retrieved by comparing the similar expression is obtained for the query frame's face with respect to the key faces expressions in the database video. Consecutive key face expressions in the database that are highly similar to the query frame's face, then the key faces are used to generate the set of retrieved video shots from the database. A concrete example of its application which realizes an affective interaction between the computer and the user is proposed. In the affective interaction, the computer can recognize the facial expression of any given video shot. This interaction endows the computer with certain ability to adapt to the user's feedback.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2711,Invariant Spectral Hashing of Image Saliency Graph,"Image hashing is the process of associating a short vector of bits to an image. The resulting summaries are useful in many applications including image indexing, image authentication and pattern recognition. These hashes need to be invariant under transformations of the image that result in similar visual content, but should drastically differ for conceptually distinct contents. This paper proposes an image hashing method that is invariant under rotation, scaling and translation of the image. The gist of our approach relies on the geometric characterization of salient point distribution in the image. This is achieved by the definition of a ""saliency graph"" connecting these points jointly with an image intensity function on the graph nodes. An invariant hash is then obtained by considering the spectrum of this function in the eigenvector basis of the Laplacian graph, that is, its graph Fourier transform. Interestingly, this spectrum is invariant under any relabeling of the graph nodes. The graph reveals geometric information of the image, making the hash robust to image transformation, yet distinct for different visual content. The efficiency of the proposed method is assessed on a set of MRI 2-D slices and on a database of faces.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2712,Asymmetric Totally-corrective Boosting for Real-time Object Detection,"Real-time object detection is one of the core problems in computer vision. The cascade boosting framework proposed by Viola and Jones has become the standard for this problem. In this framework, the learning goal for each node is asymmetric, which is required to achieve a high detection rate and a moderate false positive rate. We develop new boosting algorithms to address this asymmetric learning problem. We show that our methods explicitly optimize asymmetric loss objectives in a totally corrective fashion. The methods are totally corrective in the sense that the coefficients of all selected weak classifiers are updated at each iteration. In contract, conventional boosting like AdaBoost is stage-wise in that only the current weak classifier's coefficient is updated. At the heart of the totally corrective boosting is the column generation technique. Experiments on face detection show that our methods outperform the state-of-the-art asymmetric boosting methods.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  image search","Many algorithms for approximate nearest neighbor search in high-dimensional spaces partition the data into clusters. At query time, in order to avoid exhaustive search, an index selects the few (or a single) clusters nearest to the query point. Clusters are often produced by the well-known $k$-means approach since it has several desirable properties. On the downside, it tends to produce clusters having quite different cardinalities. Imbalanced clusters negatively impact both the variance and the expectation of query response times. This paper proposes to modify $k$-means centroids to produce clusters with more comparable sizes without sacrificing the desirable properties. Experiments with a large scale collection of image descriptors show that our algorithm significantly reduces the variance of response times without seriously impacting the search quality.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The common goals concern are the image clearance and simplification, which are parts of de-noising or compression. We applied an effective procedure to reduce the dimension of the input vectors using PCA. Radial Basis Function (RBF) neural network is then used as a function approximation network to detect where either the input image is contained a face or not and if there is a face exists then tell about its orientation. We will show how RBF can perform well then back-propagation algorithm and give some solution for better regularization of the RBF (GRNN) network.

In this work, we show that simple features other than Haar-like features can also be applied for training an effective face detector. Since, single feature is not discriminative enough to separate faces from difficult non-faces, we further improve the generalization performance of our simple features by introducing feature co-occurrences. We demonstrate that our proposed features yield a performance improvement compared to Haar-like features. In addition, our findings indicate that features play a crucial role in the ability of the system to generalize.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Currently, most of the image segmentation algorithms are designed based on the idea that images are partitioned into a set of regions preserving homogeneous intra-regions and inhomogeneous inter-regions. However, human visual intuition does not always follow this pattern. A new image segmentation method named Visual-Hint Boundary to Segment (VHBS) is introduced, which is more consistent with human perceptions. VHBS abides by two visual hint rules based on human perceptions: (i) the global scale boundaries tend to be the real boundaries of the objects; (ii) two adjacent regions with quite different colors or textures tend to result in the real boundaries between them. It has been demonstrated by experiments that, compared with traditional image segmentation method, VHBS has better performance and also preserves higher computational efficiency.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Such a module can be used either for information of the driver, or could even serve for automatic setting of the maximum speed of a smart Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC). Our system is based on a joint interpretation of cartographic information (for static reference information) with on-board vision, used for traffic sign detection and recognition (including supplementary sub-signs) and visual road lines localization (for detection of lane changes). The visual traffic sign detection part is quite robust (90% global correct detection and recognition for main speed signs, and 80% for exit-lane sub-signs detection). Our approach for joint interpretation with cartography is original, and logic-based rather than probability-based, which allows correct behaviour even in cases, which do happen, when both vision and cartography may provide the same erroneous information.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2722,3-D Rigid Models from Partial Views - Global Factorization,"The so-called factorization methods recover 3-D rigid structure from motion by factorizing an observation matrix that collects 2-D projections of features. These methods became popular due to their robustness - they use a large number of views, which constrains adequately the solution - and computational simplicity - the large number of unknowns is computed through an SVD, avoiding non-linear optimization. However, they require that all the entries of the observation matrix are known. This is unlikely to happen in practice, due to self-occlusion and limited field of view. Also, when processing long videos, regions that become occluded often appear again later. Current factorization methods process these as new regions, leading to less accurate estimates of 3-D structure. In this paper, we propose a global factorization method that infers complete 3-D models directly from the 2-D projections in the entire set of available video frames. Our method decides whether a region that has become visible is a region that was seen before, or a previously unseen region, in a global way, i.e., by seeking the simplest rigid object that describes well the entire set of observations. This global approach increases significantly the accuracy of the estimates of the 3-D shape of the scene and the 3-D motion of the camera. Experiments with artificial and real videos illustrate the good performance of our method.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2723,Maximum Likelihood Mosaics,"The majority of the approaches to the automatic recovery of a panoramic image from a set of partial views are suboptimal in the sense that the input images are aligned, or registered, pair by pair, e.g., consecutive frames of a video clip. These approaches lead to propagation errors that may be very severe, particularly when dealing with videos that show the same region at disjoint time intervals. Although some authors have proposed a post-processing step to reduce the registration errors in these situations, there have not been attempts to compute the optimal solution, i.e., the registrations leading to the panorama that best matches the entire set of partial views}. This is our goal. In this paper, we use a generative model for the partial views of the panorama and develop an algorithm to compute in an efficient way the Maximum Likelihood estimate of all the unknowns involved: the parameters describing the alignment of all the images and the panorama itself.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2724,"ANSIG - An Analytic Signature for Arbitrary 2D Shapes (or Bags of
  Unlabeled Points)","In image analysis, many tasks require representing two-dimensional (2D) shape, often specified by a set of 2D points, for comparison purposes. The challenge of the representation is that it must not only capture the characteristics of the shape but also be invariant to relevant transformations. Invariance to geometric transformations, such as translation, rotation, and scale, has received attention in the past, usually under the assumption that the points are previously labeled, i.e., that the shape is characterized by an ordered set of landmarks. However, in many practical scenarios, the points describing the shape are obtained from automatic processes, e.g., edge or corner detection, thus without labels or natural ordering. Obviously, the combinatorial problem of computing the correspondences between the points of two shapes in the presence of the aforementioned geometrical distortions becomes a quagmire when the number of points is large. We circumvent this problem by representing shapes in a way that is invariant to the permutation of the landmarks, i.e., we represent bags of unlabeled 2D points. Within our framework, a shape is mapped to an analytic function on the complex plane, leading to what we call its analytic signature (ANSIG). To store an ANSIG, it suffices to sample it along a closed contour in the complex plane. We show that the ANSIG is a maximal invariant with respect to the permutation group, i.e., that different shapes have different ANSIGs and shapes that differ by a permutation (or re-labeling) of the landmarks have the same ANSIG. We further show how easy it is to factor out geometric transformations when comparing shapes using the ANSIG representation. Finally, we illustrate these capabilities with shape-based image classification experiments.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2725,"Revisiting Complex Moments For 2D Shape Representation and Image
  Normalization","When comparing 2D shapes, a key issue is their normalization. Translation and scale are easily taken care of by removing the mean and normalizing the energy. However, defining and computing the orientation of a 2D shape is not so simple. In fact, although for elongated shapes the principal axis can be used to define one of two possible orientations, there is no such tool for general shapes. As we show in the paper, previous approaches fail to compute the orientation of even noiseless observations of simple shapes. We address this problem. In the paper, we show how to uniquely define the orientation of an arbitrary 2D shape, in terms of what we call its Principal Moments. We show that a small subset of these moments suffice to represent the underlying 2D shape and propose a new method to efficiently compute the shape orientation: Principal Moment Analysis. Finally, we discuss how this method can further be applied to normalize grey-level images. Besides the theoretical proof of correctness, we describe experiments demonstrating robustness to noise and illustrating the method with real images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2726,Statistical Compressive Sensing of Gaussian Mixture Models,"A new framework of compressive sensing (CS), namely statistical compressive sensing (SCS), that aims at efficiently sampling a collection of signals that follow a statistical distribution and achieving accurate reconstruction on average, is introduced. For signals following a Gaussian distribution, with Gaussian or Bernoulli sensing matrices of O(k) measurements, considerably smaller than the O(k log(N/k)) required by conventional CS, where N is the signal dimension, and with an optimal decoder implemented with linear filtering, significantly faster than the pursuit decoders applied in conventional CS, the error of SCS is shown tightly upper bounded by a constant times the k-best term approximation error, with overwhelming probability. The failure probability is also significantly smaller than that of conventional CS. Stronger yet simpler results further show that for any sensing matrix, the error of Gaussian SCS is upper bounded by a constant times the k-best term approximation with probability one, and the bound constant can be efficiently calculated. For signals following Gaussian mixture models, SCS with a piecewise linear decoder is introduced and shown to produce for real images better results than conventional CS based on sparse models.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2727,"Collaborative Sources Identification in Mixed Signals via Hierarchical
  Sparse Modeling","A collaborative framework for detecting the different sources in mixed signals is presented in this paper. The approach is based on C-HiLasso, a convex collaborative hierarchical sparse model, and proceeds as follows. First, we build a structured dictionary for mixed signals by concatenating a set of sub-dictionaries, each one of them learned to sparsely model one of a set of possible classes. Then, the coding of the mixed signal is performed by efficiently solving a convex optimization problem that combines standard sparsity with group and collaborative sparsity. The present sources are identified by looking at the sub-dictionaries automatically selected in the coding. The collaborative filtering in C-HiLasso takes advantage of the temporal/spatial redundancy in the mixed signals, letting collections of samples collaborate in identifying the classes, while allowing individual samples to have different internal sparse representations. This collaboration is critical to further stabilize the sparse representation of signals, in particular the class/sub-dictionary selection. The internal sparsity inside the sub-dictionaries, as naturally incorporated by the hierarchical aspects of C-HiLasso, is critical to make the model consistent with the essence of the sub-dictionaries that have been trained for sparse representation of each individual class. We present applications from speaker and instrument identification and texture separation. In the case of audio signals, we use sparse modeling to describe the short-term power spectrum envelopes of harmonic sounds. The proposed pitch independent method automatically detects the number of sources on a recording.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2728,Selective Image Super-Resolution,"In this paper we propose a vision system that performs image Super Resolution (SR) with selectivity. Conventional SR techniques, either by multi-image fusion or example-based construction, have failed to capitalize on the intrinsic structural and semantic context in the image, and performed ""blind"" resolution recovery to the entire image area. By comparison, we advocate example-based selective SR whereby selectivity is exemplified in three aspects: region selectivity (SR only at object regions), source selectivity (object SR with trained object dictionaries), and refinement selectivity (object boundaries refinement using matting). The proposed system takes over-segmented low-resolution images as inputs, assimilates recent learning techniques of sparse coding (SC) and grouped multi-task lasso (GMTL), and leads eventually to a framework for joint figure-ground separation and interest object SR. The efficiency of our framework is manifested in our experiments with subsets of the VOC2009 and MSRC datasets. We also demonstrate several interesting vision applications that can build on our system.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2729,"Multiple View Reconstruction of Calibrated Images using Singular Value
  Decomposition","Calibration in a multi camera network has widely been studied for over several years starting from the earlier days of photogrammetry. Many authors have presented several calibration algorithms with their relative advantages and disadvantages. In a stereovision system, multiple view reconstruction is a challenging task. However, the total computational procedure in detail has not been presented before. Here in this work, we are dealing with the problem that, when a world coordinate point is fixed in space, image coordinates of that 3D point vary for different camera positions and orientations. In computer vision aspect, this situation is undesirable. That is, the system has to be designed in such a way that image coordinate of the world coordinate point will be fixed irrespective of the position & orientation of the cameras. We have done it in an elegant fashion. Firstly, camera parameters are calculated in its local coordinate system. Then, we use global coordinate data to transfer all local coordinate data of stereo cameras into same global coordinate system, so that we can register everything into this global coordinate system. After all the transformations, when the image coordinate of the world coordinate point is calculated, it gives same coordinate value for all camera positions & orientations. That is, the whole system is calibrated.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2730,Lesion Border Detection in Dermoscopy Images,"Background: Dermoscopy is one of the major imaging modalities used in the diagnosis of melanoma and other pigmented skin lesions. Due to the difficulty and subjectivity of human interpretation, computerized analysis of dermoscopy images has become an important research area. One of the most important steps in dermoscopy image analysis is the automated detection of lesion borders. Methods: In this article, we present a systematic overview of the recent border detection methods in the literature paying particular attention to computational issues and evaluation aspects. Conclusion: Common problems with the existing approaches include the acquisition, size, and diagnostic distribution of the test image set, the evaluation of the results, and the inadequate description of the employed methods. Border determination by dermatologists appears to depend upon higher-level knowledge, therefore it is likely that the incorporation of domain knowledge in automated methods will enable them to perform better, especially in sets of images with a variety of diagnoses.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2731,"Featureless 2D-3D Pose Estimation by Minimising an
  Illumination-Invariant Loss","The problem of identifying the 3D pose of a known object from a given 2D image has important applications in Computer Vision ranging from robotic vision to image analysis. Our proposed method of registering a 3D model of a known object on a given 2D photo of the object has numerous advantages over existing methods: It does neither require prior training nor learning, nor knowledge of the camera parameters, nor explicit point correspondences or matching features between image and model. Unlike techniques that estimate a partial 3D pose (as in an overhead view of traffic or machine parts on a conveyor belt), our method estimates the complete 3D pose of the object, and works on a single static image from a given view, and under varying and unknown lighting conditions. For this purpose we derive a novel illumination-invariant distance measure between 2D photo and projected 3D model, which is then minimised to find the best pose parameters. Results for vehicle pose detection are presented.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2732,Single Frame Image super Resolution using Learned Directionlets,"In this paper, a new directionally adaptive, learning based, single image super resolution method using multiple direction wavelet transform, called Directionlets is presented. This method uses directionlets to effectively capture directional features and to extract edge information along different directions of a set of available high resolution images .This information is used as the training set for super resolving a low resolution input image and the Directionlet coefficients at finer scales of its high-resolution image are learned locally from this training set and the inverse Directionlet transform recovers the super-resolved high resolution image. The simulation results showed that the proposed approach outperforms standard interpolation techniques like Cubic spline interpolation as well as standard Wavelet-based learning, both visually and in terms of the mean squared error (mse) values. This method gives good result with aliased images also.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2733,Bounded Multivariate Surfaces On Monovariate Internal Functions,"Combining the properties of monovariate internal functions as proposed in Kolmogorov superimposition theorem, in tandem with the bounds wielded by the multivariate formulation of Chebyshev inequality, a hybrid model is presented, that decomposes images into homogeneous probabilistically bounded multivariate surfaces. Given an image, the model shows a novel way of working on reduced image representation while processing and capturing the interaction among the multidimensional information that describes the content of the same. Further, it tackles the practical issues of preventing leakage by bounding the growth of surface and reducing the problem sample size. The model if used, also sheds light on how the Chebyshev parameter relates to the number of pixels and the dimensionality of the feature space that associates with a pixel. Initial segmentation results on the Berkeley image segmentation benchmark indicate the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition algorithm.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2734,Classification with Scattering Operators,A scattering vector is a local descriptor including multiscale and multi-direction co-occurrence information. It is computed with a cascade of wavelet decompositions and complex modulus. This scattering representation is locally translation invariant and linearizes deformations.

State of the art results are obtained for handwritten digit recognition and texture classification.,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2735,The Data Replication Method for the Classification with Reject Option,"Classification is one of the most important tasks of machine learning. Although the most well studied model is the two-class problem, in many scenarios there is the opportunity to label critical items for manual revision, instead of trying to automatically classify every item. In this paper we adapt a paradigm initially proposed for the classification of ordinal data to address the classification problem with reject option. The technique reduces the problem of classifying with reject option to the standard two-class problem. The introduced method is then mapped into support vector machines and neural networks. Finally, the framework is extended to multiclass ordinal data with reject option. An experimental study with synthetic and real data sets, verifies the usefulness of the proposed approach.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2736,A Fuzzy Clustering Model for Fuzzy Data with Outliers,"In this paper a fuzzy clustering model for fuzzy data with outliers is proposed. The model is based on Wasserstein distance between interval valued data which is generalized to fuzzy data. In addition, Keller's approach is used to identify outliers and reduce their influences. We have also defined a transformation to change our distance to the Euclidean distance. With the help of this approach, the problem of fuzzy clustering of fuzzy data is reduced to fuzzy clustering of crisp data. In order to show the performance of the proposed clustering algorithm, two simulation experiments are discussed.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2737,Generalized Tree-Based Wavelet Transform,"In this paper we propose a new wavelet transform applicable to functions defined on graphs, high dimensional data and networks. The proposed method generalizes the Haar-like transform proposed in [1], and it is defined via a hierarchical tree, which is assumed to capture the geometry and structure of the input data. It is applied to the data using a modified version of the common one-dimensional (1D) wavelet filtering and decimation scheme, which can employ different wavelet filters. In each level of this wavelet decomposition scheme, a permutation derived from the tree is applied to the approximation coefficients, before they are filtered. We propose a tree construction method that results in an efficient representation of the input function in the transform domain. We show that the proposed transform is more efficient than both the 1D and two-dimensional (2D) separable wavelet transforms in representing images. We also explore the application of the proposed transform to image denoising, and show that combined with a subimage averaging scheme, it achieves denoising results which are similar to those obtained with the K-SVD algorithm.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2738,Edge Preserving Image Denoising in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces,"The goal of this paper is the development of a novel approach for the problem of Noise Removal, based on the theory of Reproducing Kernels Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). The problem is cast as an optimization task in a RKHS, by taking advantage of the celebrated semiparametric Representer Theorem. Examples verify that in the presence of gaussian noise the proposed method performs relatively well compared to wavelet based technics and outperforms them significantly in the presence of impulse or mixed noise.   A more detailed version of this work has been published in the IEEE Trans. Im. Proc. : P. Bouboulis, K. Slavakis and S.

2739,Learning sparse representations of depth,"This paper introduces a new method for learning and inferring sparse representations of depth (disparity) maps. The proposed algorithm relaxes the usual assumption of the stationary noise model in sparse coding. This enables learning from data corrupted with spatially varying noise or uncertainty, typically obtained by laser range scanners or structured light depth cameras. Sparse representations are learned from the Middlebury database disparity maps and then exploited in a two-layer graphical model for inferring depth from stereo, by including a sparsity prior on the learned features. Since they capture higher-order dependencies in the depth structure, these priors can complement smoothness priors commonly used in depth inference based on Markov Random Field (MRF) models. Inference on the proposed graph is achieved using an alternating iterative optimization technique, where the first layer is solved using an existing MRF-based stereo matching algorithm, then held fixed as the second layer is solved using the proposed non-stationary sparse coding algorithm. This leads to a general method for improving solutions of state of the art MRF-based depth estimation algorithms. Our experimental results first show that depth inference using learned representations leads to state of the art denoising of depth maps obtained from laser range scanners and a time of flight camera. Furthermore, we show that adding sparse priors improves the results of two depth estimation methods: the classical graph cut algorithm by Boykov et al. and the more recent algorithm of Woodford et al.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2740,Sparse motion segmentation using multiple six-point consistencies,"We present a method for segmenting an arbitrary number of moving objects in image sequences using the geometry of 6 points in 2D to infer motion consistency. The method has been evaluated on the Hopkins 155 database and surpasses current state-of-the-art methods such as SSC, both in terms of overall performance on two and three motions but also in terms of maximum errors. The method works by finding initial clusters in the spatial domain, and then classifying each remaining point as belonging to the cluster that minimizes a motion consistency score. In contrast to most other motion segmentation methods that are based on an affine camera model, the proposed method is fully projective.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

We do so by using a refor- mulation of the Huber metric and carefully chosen prior distributions. Our proposed method is invariant to 2-dimensional affine transforma- tions and, because it is relatively easy to train and use, it is suited for general object matching problems.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2742,Real-time Visual Tracking Using Sparse Representation,"The $\ell_1$ tracker obtains robustness by seeking a sparse representation of the tracking object via $\ell_1$ norm minimization \cite{Xue_ICCV_09_Track}. However, the high computational complexity involved in the $ \ell_1 $ tracker restricts its further applications in real time processing scenario. Hence we propose a Real Time Compressed Sensing Tracking (RTCST) by exploiting the signal recovery power of Compressed Sensing (CS). Dimensionality reduction and a customized Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP) algorithm are adopted to accelerate the CS tracking. As a result, our algorithm achieves a real-time speed that is up to $6,000$ times faster than that of the $\ell_1$ tracker. Meanwhile, RTCST still produces competitive (sometimes even superior) tracking accuracy comparing to the existing $\ell_1$ tracker. Furthermore, for a stationary camera, a further refined tracker is designed by integrating a CS-based background model (CSBM). This CSBM-equipped tracker coined as RTCST-B, outperforms most state-of-the-arts with respect to both accuracy and robustness. Finally, our experimental results on various video sequences, which are verified by a new metric---Tracking Success Probability (TSP), show the excellence of the proposed algorithms.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2743,TILT: Transform Invariant Low-rank Textures,"In this paper, we show how to efficiently and effectively extract a class of ""low-rank textures"" in a 3D scene from 2D images despite significant corruptions and warping. The low-rank textures capture geometrically meaningful structures in an image, which encompass conventional local features such as edges and corners as well as all kinds of regular, symmetric patterns ubiquitous in urban environments and man-made objects. Our approach to finding these low-rank textures leverages the recent breakthroughs in convex optimization that enable robust recovery of a high-dimensional low-rank matrix despite gross sparse errors. In the case of planar regions with significant affine or projective deformation, our method can accurately recover both the intrinsic low-rank texture and the precise domain transformation, and hence the 3D geometry and appearance of the planar regions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that this new technique works effectively for many regular and near-regular patterns or objects that are approximately low-rank, such as symmetrical patterns, building facades, printed texts, and human faces.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

In this paper, we formulate a diffusion-geometric framework for stable component detection in non-rigid 3D shapes, which can be used for geometric feature detection and description.

Here, we use definitions of affine invariant arclength for surfaces in R^3 in order to extend the set of existing non-rigid shape analysis tools. In fact, we show that by re-defining the surface metric as its equi-affine version, the surface with its modified metric tensor can be treated as a canonical Euclidean object on which most classical Euclidean processing and analysis tools can be applied. The new definition of a metric is used to extend the fast marching method technique for computing geodesic distances on surfaces, where now, the distances are defined with respect to an affine invariant arclength.

The estimation of the optical flow head tracker is used as starting point for the template tracker which fine-tunes the head estimation. This approach together with re-updating the optical flow points prevents the head tracker from drifting.

Abnormal (higher) iron accumulation has been detected in the brains of most neurodegenerative patients, especially in the basal ganglia region. Presence of iron leads to changes in MR signal in both magnitude and phase. Accordingly, tissues with high iron concentration appear hypo-intense (darker than usual) in MR contrasts. In this report, we proposed an improved binary hypointensity description and a novel nonbinary hypointensity description based on principle components analysis. Moreover, Kendall's rank correlation coefficient was used to compare the complementary and redundant information provided by the two methods in order to better understand the individual descriptions of iron accumulation in the brain.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2750,Combining Neural Networks for Skin Detection,"Two types of combining strategies were evaluated namely combining skin features and combining skin classifiers. Several combining rules were applied where the outputs of the skin classifiers are combined using binary operators such as the AND and the OR operators, ""Voting"", ""Sum of Weights"" and a new neural network. Three chrominance components from the YCbCr colour space that gave the highest correct detection on their single feature MLP were selected as the combining parameters. A major issue in designing a MLP neural network is to determine the optimal number of hidden units given a set of training patterns. Therefore, a ""coarse to fine search"" method to find the number of neurons in the hidden layer is proposed. The strategy of combining Cb/Cr and Cr features improved the correct detection by 3.01% compared to the best single feature MLP given by Cb-Cr. The strategy of combining the outputs of three skin classifiers using the ""Sum of Weights"" rule further improved the correct detection by 4.38% compared to the best single feature MLP.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Extraction of text regions and segmenting them into characters is one of such challenges. In this paper, we have presented an efficient character segmentation technique for business card images captured by a cell-phone camera, designed in our present work towards developing an efficient BCR. At first, text regions are extracted from the card images and then the skewed ones are corrected using a computationally efficient skew correction technique. At last, these skew corrected text regions are segmented into lines and characters based on horizontal and vertical histogram. Experiments show that the present technique is efficient and applicable for mobile devices, and the mean segmentation accuracy of 97.48% is achieved with 3 mega-pixel (500-600 dpi) images.

2757,"A Panorama on Multiscale Geometric Representations, Intertwining
  Spatial, Directional and Frequency Selectivity","The richness of natural images makes the quest for optimal representations in image processing and computer vision challenging. The latter observation has not prevented the design of image representations, which trade off between efficiency and complexity, while achieving accurate rendering of smooth regions as well as reproducing faithful contours and textures. The most recent ones, proposed in the past decade, share an hybrid heritage highlighting the multiscale and oriented nature of edges and patterns in images. This paper presents a panorama of the aforementioned literature on decompositions in multiscale, multi-orientation bases or dictionaries. They typically exhibit redundancy to improve sparsity in the transformed domain and sometimes its invariance with respect to simple geometric deformations (translation, rotation). Oriented multiscale dictionaries extend traditional wavelet processing and may offer rotation invariance. Highly redundant dictionaries require specific algorithms to simplify the search for an efficient (sparse) representation. We also discuss the extension of multiscale geometric decompositions to non-Euclidean domains such as the sphere or arbitrary meshed surfaces. The etymology of panorama suggests an overview, based on a choice of partially overlapping ""pictures"".

2759,"A Semi-Automatic Graph-Based Approach for Determining the Boundary of
  Eloquent Fiber Bundles in the Human Brain","Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) allows estimating the position, orientation and dimension of bundles of nerve pathways. This non-invasive imaging technique takes advantage of the diffusion of water molecules and determines the diffusion coefficients for every voxel of the data set. The identification of the diffusion coefficients and the derivation of information about fiber bundles is of major interest for planning and performing neurosurgical interventions. To minimize the risk of neural deficits during brain surgery as tumor resection (e.g. glioma), the segmentation and integration of the results in the operating room is of prime importance. In this contribution, a robust and efficient graph-based approach for segmentating tubular fiber bundles in the human brain is presented. To define a cost function, the fractional anisotropy (FA) is used, derived from the DTI data, but this value may differ from patient to patient. Besides manually definining seed regions describing the structure of interest, additionally a manual definition of the cost function by the user is necessary. To improve the approach the contribution introduces a solution for automatically determining the cost function by using different 3D masks for each individual data set.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Knowledge about this is of high importance for preoperative planning of neurosurgical interventions and for intraoperative guidance by neuronavigation in order to minimize postoperative neurological deficits. Therefore, the segmentation of these structures as closed, three-dimensional object is necessary. In this contribution, two methods for fiber bundle segmentation between two defined regions are compared using software phantoms (abstract model and anatomical phantom modeling the right corticospinal tract). One method uses evaluation points from sampled rays as candidates for boundary points, the other method sets up a directed and weighted (depending on a scalar measure) graph and performs a min-cut for optimal segmentation results. Comparison is done by using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), a measure for spatial overlap of different segmentation results.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  Historical Manuscript Images","Historical documents such as old books and manuscripts have a high aesthetic value and highly appreciated. Unfortunately, there are some documents cannot be read due to quality problems like faded paper, ink expand, uneven colour tone, torn paper and other elements disruption such as the existence of small spots. The study aims to produce a copy of manuscript that shows clear wordings so they can easily be read and the copy can also be displayed for visitors. 16 samples of Jawi historical manuscript with different quality problems were obtained from The Royal Museum of Pahang, Malaysia. We applied three binarization techniques; Otsu's method represents global threshold technique; Sauvola and Niblack method which are categorized as local threshold techniques. We compared the binarized images with the original manuscript to be visually inspected by the museum's curator. The unclear features were marked and analyzed. Most of the examined images show that with optimal parameters and effective pre processing technique, local thresholding methods are work well compare with the other one. Niblack's and Sauvola's techniques seem to be the suitable approaches for these types of images. Most of binarized images with these two methods show improvement for readability and character recognition. For this research, even the differences of image result were hard to be distinguished by human capabilities, after comparing the time cost and overall achievement rate of recognized symbols, Niblack's method is performing better than Sauvola's.

2766,Improved Edge Awareness in Discontinuity Preserving Smoothing,"Discontinuity preserving smoothing is a fundamentally important procedure that is useful in a wide variety of image processing contexts. It is directly useful for noise reduction, and frequently used as an intermediate step in higher level algorithms. For example, it can be particularly useful in edge detection and segmentation. Three well known algorithms for discontinuity preserving smoothing are nonlinear anisotropic diffusion, bilateral filtering, and mean shift filtering. Although slight differences make them each better suited to different tasks, all are designed to preserve discontinuities while smoothing. However, none of them satisfy this goal perfectly: they each have exception cases in which smoothing may occur across hard edges. The principal contribution of this paper is the identification of a property we call edge awareness that should be satisfied by any discontinuity preserving smoothing algorithm. This constraint can be incorporated into existing algorithms to improve quality, and usually has negligible changes in runtime performance and/or complexity. We present modifications necessary to augment diffusion and mean shift, as well as a new formulation of the bilateral filter that unifies the spatial and range spaces to achieve edge awareness.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The estimation of these entities is central to most reconstruction algorithms, and a solid understanding of their properties and constraints is therefore very important. The fundamental matrix has 1 internal constraint which is well understood, whereas the trifocal tensor has 8 independent algebraic constraints. The internal tensor constraints can be represented in many ways, although there is only one minimal and sufficient set of 8 constraints known. In this paper, we derive a second set of minimal and sufficient constraints that is simpler. We also show how this can be used in a new parameterization of the trifocal tensor. We hope that this increased understanding of the internal constraints may lead to improved algorithms for estimating the trifocal tensor, although the primary contribution is an improved theoretical understanding.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2773,Benchmarking the Quality of Diffusion-Weighted Images,"We present a novel method that allows for measuring the quality of diffusion-weighted MR images dependent on the image resolution and the image noise. For this purpose, we introduce a new thresholding technique so that noise and the signal can automatically be estimated from a single data set. Thus, no user interaction as well as no double acquisition technique, which requires a time-consuming proper geometrical registration, is needed. As a coarser image resolution or slice thickness leads to a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), our benchmark determines a resolution-independent quality measure so that images with different resolutions can be adequately compared. To evaluate our method, a set of diffusion-weighted images from different vendors is used. It is shown that the quality can efficiently be determined and that the automatically computed SNR is comparable to the SNR which is measured manually in a manually selected region of interest.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The iteratively extracted parts using the level curves with double point singularities are organized as a proper binary tree.

2778,"Extracting Parts of 2D Shapes Using Local and Global Interactions
  Simultaneously","Perception research provides strong evidence in favor of part based representation of shapes in human visual system. Despite considerable differences among different theories in terms of how part boundaries are found, there is substantial agreement on that the process depends on many local and global geometric factors. This poses an important challenge from the computational point of view. In the first part of the chapter, I present a novel decomposition method by taking both local and global interactions within the shape domain into account. At the top of the partitioning hierarchy, the shape gets split into two parts capturing, respectively, the gross structure and the peripheral structure. The gross structure may be conceived as the least deformable part of the shape which remains stable under visual transformations. The peripheral structure includes limbs, protrusions, and boundary texture. Such a separation is in accord with the behavior of the artists who start with a gross shape and enrich it with details. The method is particularly interesting from the computational point of view as it does not resort to any geometric notions (e.g. curvature, convexity) explicitly. In the second part of the chapter, I relate the new method to PDE based shape representation schemes.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2779,An Axis-Based Representation for Recognition,"This paper presents a new axis-based shape representation scheme along with a matching framework to address the problem of generic shape recognition. The main idea is to define the relative spatial arrangement of local symmetry axes and their metric properties in a shape centered coordinate frame. The resulting descriptions are invariant to scale, rotation, small changes in viewpoint and articulations. Symmetry points are extracted from a surface whose level curves roughly mimic the motion by curvature. By increasing the amount of smoothing on the evolving curve, only those symmetry axes that correspond to the most prominent parts of a shape are extracted. The representation does not suffer from the common instability problems of the traditional connected skeletons. It captures the perceptual qualities of shapes well. Therefore finding the similarities and the differences among shapes becomes easier. The matching process gives highly successful results on a diverse database of 2D shapes.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2780,Disconnected Skeleton: Shape at its Absolute Scale,"We present a new skeletal representation along with a matching framework to address the deformable shape recognition problem. The disconnectedness arises as a result of excessive regularization that we use to describe a shape at an attainably coarse scale. Our motivation is to rely on the stable properties of the shape instead of inaccurately measured secondary details. The new representation does not suffer from the common instability problems of traditional connected skeletons, and the matching process gives quite successful results on a diverse database of 2D shapes. An important difference of our approach from the conventional use of the skeleton is that we replace the local coordinate frame with a global Euclidean frame supported by additional mechanisms to handle articulations and local boundary deformations. As a result, we can produce descriptions that are sensitive to any combination of changes in scale, position, orientation and articulation, as well as invariant ones.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

We compare the performance of our color-aware version of STIP (which we have called HueSTIP) with the original one.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2782,A Meshless Method for Variational Nonrigid 2-D Shape Registration,"We present a method for nonrigid registration of 2-D geometric shapes. Our contribution is twofold. First, we extend the classic chamfer-matching energy to a variational functional. Secondly, we introduce a meshless deformation model that can handle significant high-curvature deformations. We represent 2-D shapes implicitly using distance transforms, and registration error is defined based on the shape contours' mutual distances. In addition, we model global shape deformation as an approximation blended from local deformation fields using partition-of-unity. The global deformation field is regularized by penalizing inconsistencies between local fields. The representation can be made adaptive to shape's contour, leading to registration that is both flexible and efficient. Finally, registration is achieved by minimizing a variational chamfer-energy functional combined with the consistency regularizer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a number of experiments.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2783,Curved Gabor Filters for Fingerprint Image Enhancement,"Gabor filters play an important role in many application areas for the enhancement of various types of images and the extraction of Gabor features. For the purpose of enhancing curved structures in noisy images, we introduce curved Gabor filters which locally adapt their shape to the direction of flow. These curved Gabor filters enable the choice of filter parameters which increase the smoothing power without creating artifacts in the enhanced image. In this paper, curved Gabor filters are applied to the curved ridge and valley structure of low-quality fingerprint images. First, we combine two orientation field estimation methods in order to obtain a more robust estimation for very noisy images. Next, curved regions are constructed by following the respective local orientation and they are used for estimating the local ridge frequency. Lastly, curved Gabor filters are defined based on curved regions and they are applied for the enhancement of low-quality fingerprint images. Experimental results on the FVC2004 databases show improvements of this approach in comparison to state-of-the-art enhancement methods.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
2784,Positive Semidefinite Metric Learning Using Boosting-like Algorithms,"The success of many machine learning and pattern recognition methods relies heavily upon the identification of an appropriate distance metric on the input data. It is often beneficial to learn such a metric from the input training data, instead of using a default one such as the Euclidean distance. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed BoostMetric, for learning a quadratic Mahalanobis distance metric. Learning a valid Mahalanobis distance metric requires enforcing the constraint that the matrix parameter to the metric remains positive definite. Semidefinite programming is often used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well and easy to implement. BoostMetric is instead based on the observation that any positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed into a linear combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. BoostMetric thus uses rank-one positive semidefinite matrices as weak learners within an efficient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting methods are easy to implement, efficient, and can accommodate various types of constraints. We extend traditional boosting algorithms in that its weak learner is a positive semidefinite matrix with trace and rank being one rather than a classifier or regressor. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithms compare favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classification accuracy and running time.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

2786,"A supervised clustering approach for fMRI-based inference of brain
  states","We propose a method that combines signals from many brain regions observed in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to predict the subject's behavior during a scanning session. Such predictions suffer from the huge number of brain regions sampled on the voxel grid of standard fMRI data sets: the curse of dimensionality. Dimensionality reduction is thus needed, but it is often performed using a univariate feature selection procedure, that handles neither the spatial structure of the images, nor the multivariate nature of the signal. By introducing a hierarchical clustering of the brain volume that incorporates connectivity constraints, we reduce the span of the possible spatial configurations to a single tree of nested regions tailored to the signal. We then prune the tree in a supervised setting, hence the name supervised clustering, in order to extract a parcellation (division of the volume) such that parcel-based signal averages best predict the target information. Dimensionality reduction is thus achieved by feature agglomeration, and the constructed features now provide a multi-scale representation of the signal. Comparisons with reference methods on both simulated and real data show that our approach yields higher prediction accuracy than standard voxel-based approaches. Moreover, the method infers an explicit weighting of the regions involved in the regression or classification task.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

Therefore, a digital and automated technique should be developed so that the implant size recognition process can be effectively implemented. For this purpose, we have introduced the new technique for acetabular implant size recognition in THR preoperative planning based on the diameter of acetabulum size. This technique enables the surgeon to recognise a digital acetabular implant size automatically.

In this paper, we present formulas to directly compute the cohomology ring of 3D cubical complexes without making use of any additional triangulation. Starting from a cubical complex $Q$ that represents a 3D binary-valued digital picture whose foreground has one connected component, we compute first the cohomological information on the boundary of the object, $\partial Q$ by an incremental technique; then, using a face reduction algorithm, we compute it on the whole object; finally, applying the mentioned formulas, the cohomology ring is computed from such information.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

The cervix region occupies about half of the raw cervigram image. Other parts of the image contain irrelevant information, such as equipment, frames, text and non-cervix tissues.

2798,Image Splicing Detection Using Inherent Lens Radial Distortion,"Image splicing is a common form of image forgery. Such alterations may leave no visual clues of tampering. In recent works camera characteristics consistency across the image has been used to establish the authenticity and integrity of digital images. Such constant camera characteristic properties are inherent from camera manufacturing processes and are unique. The majority of digital cameras are equipped with spherical lens and this introduces radial distortions on images. This aberration is often disturbed and fails to be consistent across the image, when an image is spliced. This paper describes the detection of splicing operation on images by estimating radial distortion from different portions of the image using line-based calibration. For the first time, the detection of image splicing through the verification of consistency of lens radial distortion has been explored in this paper. The conducted experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach for the detection of image splicing on both synthetic and real images.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

We learn a classifier that can recognize six basic emotions with an average accuracy of 77% over the Cohn-Kanade database. The novelty of this work is that instead of empirically selecting the parameters of the neural network, i.e. the learning rate, activation function parameter, momentum number, the number of nodes in one layer, etc. we developed a strategy that can automatically select comparatively better combination of these parameters. We also introduce another way to perform back propagation. Instead of using the partial differential of the error function, we use optimal algorithm; namely Powell's direction set to minimize the error function. We were also interested in construction an authentic emotion databases. This is a very important task because nowadays there is no such database available. Finally, we perform several experiments and show that our neural network approach can be successfully used for emotion recognition.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

We show that our set of transformations is rich enough to formulate operations such as moving average and time warping. We present a query processing algorithm that uses the underlying R-tree index of a multidimensional data set to answer similarity queries efficiently. Our experiments show that the performance of this algorithm is competitive to that of processing ordinary (exact match) queries using the index, and much faster than sequential scanning. We relate our transformations to the general framework for similarity queries of Jagadish et al.",Databases
3152,Efficient Retrieval of Similar Time Sequences Using DFT,"We propose an improvement of the known DFT-based indexing technique for fast retrieval of similar time sequences. We use the last few Fourier coefficients in the distance computation without storing them in the index since every coefficient at the end is the complex conjugate of a coefficient at the beginning and as strong as its counterpart. We show analytically that this observation can accelerate the search time of the index by more than a factor of two. This result was confirmed by our experiments, which were carried out on real stock prices and synthetic data.",Databases
3153,Least expected cost query optimization: an exercise in utility,"We identify two unreasonable, though standard, assumptions made by database query optimizers that can adversely affect the quality of the chosen evaluation plans. One assumption is that it is enough to optimize for the expected case---that is, the case where various parameters (like available memory) take on their expected value. The other assumption is that the parameters are constant throughout the execution of the query. We present an algorithm based on the ``System R''-style query optimization algorithm that does not rely on these assumptions. The algorithm we present chooses the plan of the least expected cost instead of the plan of least cost given some fixed value of the parameters. In execution environments that exhibit a high degree of variability, our techniques should result in better performance.",Databases
3154,Efficient and Extensible Algorithms for Multi Query Optimization,"Complex queries are becoming commonplace, with the growing use of decision support systems. These complex queries often have a lot of common sub-expressions, either within a single query, or across multiple such queries run as a batch. Multi-query optimization aims at exploiting common sub-expressions to reduce evaluation cost. Multi-query optimization has hither-to been viewed as impractical, since earlier algorithms were exhaustive, and explore a doubly exponential search space.   In this paper we demonstrate that multi-query optimization using heuristics is practical, and provides significant benefits. We propose three cost-based heuristic algorithms: Volcano-SH and Volcano-RU, which are based on simple modifications to the Volcano search strategy, and a greedy heuristic. Our greedy heuristic incorporates novel optimizations that improve efficiency greatly. Our algorithms are designed to be easily added to existing optimizers. We present a performance study comparing the algorithms, using workloads consisting of queries from the TPC-D benchmark. The study shows that our algorithms provide significant benefits over traditional optimization, at a very acceptable overhead in optimization time.",Databases

3156,"Don't Trash your Intermediate Results, Cache 'em","In data warehouse and data mart systems, queries often take a long time to execute due to their complex nature. Query response times can be greatly improved by caching final/intermediate results of previous queries, and using them to answer later queries. In this paper we describe a caching system called Exchequer which incorporates several novel features including optimization aware cache maintenance and the use of a cache aware optimizer. In contrast, in existing work, the module that makes cost-benefit decisions is part of the cache manager and works independent of the optimizer which essentially reconsiders these decisions while finding the best plan for a query. In our work, the optimizer takes the decisions for the cache manager. Furthermore, existing approaches are either restricted to cube (slice/point) queries, or cache just the query results. On the other hand, our work is extens ible and in fact presents a data-model independent framework and algorithm. Our experimental results attest to the efficacy of our cache management techniques and show that over a wide range of parameters (a) Exchequer's query response times are lower by more than 30% compared to the best performing competitor, and (b) Exchequer can deliver the same response time as its competitor with just one tenth of the cache size.",Databases
3157,"Materialized View Selection and Maintenance Using Multi-Query
  Optimization","Because the presence of views enhances query performance, materialized views are increasingly being supported by commercial database/data warehouse systems. Whenever the data warehouse is updated, the materialized views must also be updated. However, whereas the amount of data entering a warehouse, the query loads, and the need to obtain up-to-date responses are all increasing, the time window available for making the warehouse up-to-date is shrinking. These trends necessitate efficient techniques for the maintenance of materialized views.   In this paper, we show how to find an efficient plan for maintenance of a {\em set} of views, by exploiting common subexpressions between different view maintenance expressions. These common subexpressions may be materialized temporarily during view maintenance. Our algorithms also choose subexpressions/indices to be materialized permanently (and maintained along with other materialized views), to speed up view maintenance. While there has been much work on view maintenance in the past, our novel contributions lie in exploiting a recently developed framework for multiquery optimization to efficiently find good view maintenance plans as above. In addition to faster view maintenance, our algorithms can also be used to efficiently select materialized views to speed up workloads containing queries.",Databases

  Modeling Approach","Recent trends in information management involve the periodic transcription of data onto secondary devices in a networked environment, and the proper scheduling of these transcriptions is critical for efficient data management. To assist in the scheduling process, we are interested in modeling the reduction of consistency over time between a relation and its replica, termed obsolescence of data. The modeling is based on techniques from the field of stochastic processes, and provides several stochastic models for content evolution in the base relations of a database, taking referential integrity constraints into account. These models are general enough to accommodate most of the common scenarios in databases, including batch insertions and life spans both with and without memory. As an initial ""proof of concept"" of the applicability of our approach, we validate the insertion portion of our model framework via experiments with real data feeds. We also discuss a set of transcription protocols which make use of the proposed stochastic model.",Databases
3159,Algorithms for Rewriting Aggregate Queries Using Views,"Queries involving aggregation are typical in database applications. One of the main ideas to optimize the execution of an aggregate query is to reuse results of previously answered queries. This leads to the problem of rewriting aggregate queries using views. Due to a lack of theory, algorithms for this problem were rather ad-hoc. They were sound, but were not proven to be complete.   Recently we have given syntactic characterizations for the equivalence of aggregate queries and applied them to decide when there exist rewritings. However, these decision procedures do not lend themselves immediately to an implementation. In this paper, we present practical algorithms for rewriting queries with $\COUNT$ and $\SUM$. Our algorithms are sound. They are also complete for important cases. Our techniques can be used to improve well-known procedures for rewriting non-aggregate queries. These procedures can then be adapted to obtain algorithms for rewriting queries with $\MIN$ and $\MAX$. The algorithms presented are a basis for realizing optimizers that rewrite queries using views.",Databases

In this paper, we describe a seamless integration scheme for database queries and association rule discovery using a common query optimizer for both. Query trees of expressions in an extended algebra are used for internal representation in the optimizer. The algebraic representation is flexible enough to deal with constrained association rule queries and other variations of association rule specifications. We propose modularization to simplify the query tree for complex tasks in data mining. It paves the way for making use of existing algorithms for constructing query plans in the optimization process. How the integration scheme we present will facilitate greater user control over the data mining process is also discussed. The work described in this paper forms part of a larger project for fully integrating data mining with database management.",Databases

In some cities, community networking initiatives are relatively mature, while in others they are in early or intermediate stages. The paper looks at several factors that help explain the evolution of community networks in cities:   1) Local government support; 2) Federal support 3) Degree of community activism, often reflected by public-private partnerships that help support community networks.   In addition to these (more or less) measurable elements of local support, the case studies enable description of the different objectives of community networks in different cities. Several community networking projects aim to improve the delivery of government services (e.g., Portland and Cleveland), some have a job-training focus (e.g., Austin, Washington, DC), others are oriented very explicitly toward community building (Nashville, DC), and others toward neighborhood entrepreneurship (Portland and Cleveland).

  Business Support","Large organizations today are being served by different types of data processing and informations systems, ranging from the operational (OLTP) systems, data warehouse systems, to data mining and business intelligence applications. It is important to create an integrated repository of what these systems contain and do in order to use them collectively and effectively. The repository contains metadata of source systems, data warehouse, and also the business metadata. Decision support and business analysis require extensive and in-depth understanding of business entities, tasks, rules and the environment. The purpose of business metadata is to provide this understanding. Realizing the importance of metadata, many standardization efforts has been initiated to define metadata models. In trying to define an integrated metadata and information systems for a banking application, we discover some important limitations or inadequacies of the business metadata proposals. They relate to providing an integrated and flexible inter-operability and navigation between metadata and data, and to the important issue of systematically handling temporal characteristics and evolution of the metadata itself.   In this paper, we study the issue of structuring business metadata so that it can provide a context for business management and decision support when integrated with data warehousing.

3166,Mragyati : A System for Keyword-based Searching in Databases,"The web, through many search engine sites, has popularized the keyword-based search paradigm, where a user can specify a string of keywords and expect to retrieve relevant documents, possibly ranked by their relevance to the query. Since a lot of information is stored in databases (and not as HTML documents), it is important to provide a similar search paradigm for databases, where users can query a database without knowing the database schema and database query languages such as SQL. In this paper, we propose such a database search system, which accepts a free-form query as a collection of keywords, translates it into queries on the database using the database metadata, and presents query results in a well-structured and browsable form. Th eysytem maps keywords onto the database schema and uses inter-relationships (i.e., data semantics) among the referred tables to generate meaningful query results.

3169,Sprinkling Selections over Join DAGs for Efficient Query Optimization,"In optimizing queries, solutions based on AND/OR DAG can generate all possible join orderings and select placements before searching for optimal query execution strategy. But as the number of joins and selection conditions increase, the space and time complexity to generate optimal query plan increases exponentially. In this paper, we use join graph for a relational database schema to either pre-compute all possible join orderings that can be executed and store it as a join DAG or, extract joins in the queries to incrementally build a history join DAG as and when the queries are executed. The select conditions in the queries are appropriately placed in the retrieved join DAG (or, history join DAG) to generate optimal query execution strategy. We experimentally evaluate our query optimization technique on TPC-D/H query sets to show their effectiveness over AND/OR DAG query optimization strategy. Finally, we illustrate how our technique can be used for efficient multiple query optimization and selection of materialized views in data warehousing environments.",Databases

We provide a complete classification of the computational complexity of consistent answers to first-order queries w.r.t. functional dependencies and denial constraints. We show how the complexity depends on the {\em type} of the constraints considered, their {\em number}, and the {\em size} of the query.

3172,Optimizing Queries Using a Meta-level Database,"Graph simulation (using graph schemata or data guides) has been successfully proposed as a technique for adding structure to semistructured data. Design patterns for description (such as meta-classes and homomorphisms between schema layers), which are prominent in the object-oriented programming community, constitute a generalization of this graph simulation approach.   In this paper, we show description applicable to a wide range of data models that have some notion of object (-identity), and propose to turn it into a data model primitive much like, say, inheritance. We argue that such an extension fills a practical need in contemporary data management. Then, we present algebraic techniques for query optimization (using the notions of described and description queries). Finally, in the semistructured setting, we discuss the pruning of regular path queries (with nested conditions) using description meta-data. In this context, our notion of meta-data extends graph schemata and data guides by meta-level values, allowing to boost query performance and to reduce the redundancy of data.",Databases
3173,Preference Queries,"The handling of user preferences is becoming an increasingly important issue in present-day information systems. Among others, preferences are used for information filtering and extraction to reduce the volume of data presented to the user. They are also used to keep track of user profiles and formulate policies to improve and automate decision making.   We propose here a simple, logical framework for formulating preferences as preference formulas. The framework does not impose any restrictions on the preference relations and allows arbitrary operation and predicate signatures in preference formulas. It also makes the composition of preference relations straightforward. We propose a simple, natural embedding of preference formulas into relational algebra (and SQL) through a single winnow operator parameterized by a preference formula. The embedding makes possible the formulation of complex preference queries, e.g., involving aggregation, by piggybacking on existing SQL constructs. It also leads in a natural way to the definition of further, preference-related concepts like ranking. Finally, we present general algebraic laws governing the winnow operator and its interaction with other relational algebra operators. The preconditions on the applicability of the laws are captured by logical formulas. The laws provide a formal foundation for the algebraic optimization of preference queries. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach through numerous examples.",Databases
3174,Answer Sets for Consistent Query Answering in Inconsistent Databases,"A relational database is inconsistent if it does not satisfy a given set of integrity constraints. Nevertheless, it is likely that most of the data in it is consistent with the constraints. In this paper we apply logic programming based on answer sets to the problem of retrieving consistent information from a possibly inconsistent database. Since consistent information persists from the original database to every of its minimal repairs, the approach is based on a specification of database repairs using disjunctive logic programs with exceptions, whose answer set semantics can be represented and computed by systems that implement stable model semantics. These programs allow us to declare persistence by defaults and repairing changes by exceptions. We concentrate mainly on logic programs for binary integrity constraints, among which we find most of the integrity constraints found in practice.",Databases

  Information Extraction","Research on information extraction from Web pages (wrapping) has seen much activity recently (particularly systems implementations), but little work has been done on formally studying the expressiveness of the formalisms proposed or on the theoretical foundations of wrapping. In this paper, we first study monadic datalog over trees as a wrapping language. We show that this simple language is equivalent to monadic second order logic (MSO) in its ability to specify wrappers. We believe that MSO has the right expressiveness required for Web information extraction and propose MSO as a yardstick for evaluating and comparing wrappers. Along the way, several other results on the complexity of query evaluation and query containment for monadic datalog over trees are established, and a simple normal form for this language is presented. Using the above results, we subsequently study the kernel fragment Elog$^-$ of the Elog wrapping language used in the Lixto system (a visual wrapper generator). Curiously, Elog$^-$ exactly captures MSO, yet is easier to use. Indeed, programs in this language can be entirely visually specified.",Databases

We assume that integrity-restoration actions are limited to tuple deletions.

We study the computational complexity of both problems, delineating the boundary between the tractable and the intractable. We consider denial constraints, general functional and inclusion dependencies, as well as key and foreign key constraints. Our results shed light on the computational feasibility of minimal-change integrity maintenance. The tractable cases should lead to practical implementations. The intractability results highlight the inherent limitations of any integrity enforcement mechanism, e.g., triggers or referential constraint actions, as a way of performing minimal-change integrity maintenance.",Databases

We define a number of practically relevant classes of spatio-temporal objects, and give complete results concerning closure under Boolean set operators for these classes.

The semantic mechanisms currently available in service registries which are based on taxonomies fail to provide the means to achieve this. Although the terms taxonomy and ontology are sometimes used interchangably there is a critical difference. A taxonomy indicates only class/subclass relationship whereas an ontology describes a domain completely. The essential mechanisms that ontology languages provide include their formal specification (which allows them to be queried) and their ability to define properties of classes. Through properties very accurate descriptions of services can be defined and services can be related to other services or resources. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of describing service semantics through ontology languages and describe how to relate the semantics defined with the services advertised in service registries like UDDI and ebXML.",Databases

In this paper we prove that the axioms are also complete for unary XFDs (XFDs with a single path on the l.h.s.).

It traces the evolution of the database, from its start as a non-computerized set of related data, to the, now standard, computerized RDBMS (relational database management system). Early computerized storage methods are reviewed including both the ISAM (Indexed Sequential Access Method) and VSAM (Virtual Storage Access Method) storage methods. Early database models are explored including the network and hierarchical database models. Eventually, the relational, object-relational and object-oriented databases models are discussed. An appendix of diagrams, including hierarchical occurrence tree, network schema, ER (entity relationship) and UML (unified modeling language) diagrams, is included to support the text.

3184,Transparent Persistence with Java Data Objects,"Flexible and performant Persistency Service is a necessary component of any HEP Software Framework. The building of a modular, non-intrusive and performant persistency component have been shown to be very difficult task. In the past, it was very often necessary to sacrifice modularity to achieve acceptable performance. This resulted in the strong dependency of the overall Frameworks on their Persistency subsystems.   Recent development in software technology has made possible to build a Persistency Service which can be transparently used from other Frameworks. Such Service doesn't force a strong architectural constraints on the overall Framework Architecture, while satisfying high performance requirements. Java Data Object standard (JDO) has been already implemented for almost all major databases. It provides truly transparent persistency for any Java object (both internal and external). Objects in other languages can be handled via transparent proxies. Being only a thin layer on top of a used database, JDO doesn't introduce any significant performance degradation. Also Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) makes possible to treat persistency as an orthogonal Aspect of the Application Framework, without polluting it with persistence-specific concepts.   All these techniques have been developed primarily (or only) for the Java environment. It is, however, possible to interface them transparently to Frameworks built in other languages, like for example C++.

This duality, in turn, provides us with an extensive library of solutions when addressing indexing questions. It is illustrated how to use the schemas, in connection with additional relational database technologies, to optimize queries conditioned on the structural information being referenced. Comparisons using bitmap indexing in the Oracle 9.2i database, on the one hand, and multidimensional clustering in DB2 8.1.2, on the other hand, are used to illustrate the applicability of the indexing to different technology settings.

3199,Providing Diversity in K-Nearest Neighbor Query Results,"Given a point query Q in multi-dimensional space, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) queries return the K closest answers according to given distance metric in the database with respect to Q. In this scenario, it is possible that a majority of the answers may be very similar to some other, especially when the data has clusters. For a variety of applications, such homogeneous result sets may not add value to the user. In this paper, we consider the problem of providing diversity in the results of KNN queries, that is, to produce the closest result set such that each answer is sufficiently different from the rest. We first propose a user-tunable definition of diversity, and then present an algorithm, called MOTLEY, for producing a diverse result set as per this definition. Through a detailed experimental evaluation on real and synthetic data, we show that MOTLEY can produce diverse result sets by reading only a small fraction of the tuples in the database. Further, it imposes no additional overhead on the evaluation of traditional KNN queries, thereby providing a seamless interface between diversity and distance.",Databases
3200,Supporting Exploratory Queries in Database Centric Web Applications,"Users of database-centric Web applications, especially in the e-commerce domain, often resort to exploratory ``trial-and-error'' queries since the underlying data space is huge and unfamiliar, and there are several alternatives for search attributes in this space. For example, scouting for cheap airfares typically involves posing multiple queries, varying flight times, dates, and airport locations. Exploratory queries are problematic from the perspective of both the user and the server. For the database server, it results in a drastic reduction in effective throughput since much of the processing is duplicated in each successive query. For the client, it results in a marked increase in response times, especially when accessing the service through wireless channels.   In this paper, we investigate the design of automated techniques to minimize the need for repetitive exploratory queries. Specifically, we present SAUNA, a server-side query relaxation algorithm that, given the user's initial range query and a desired cardinality for the answer set, produces a relaxed query that is expected to contain the required number of answers. The algorithm incorporates a range-query-specific distance metric that is weighted to produce relaxed queries of a desired shape (e.g. aspect ratio preserving), and utilizes multi-dimensional histograms for query size estimation. A detailed performance evaluation of SAUNA over a variety of multi-dimensional data sets indicates that its relaxed queries can significantly reduce the costs associated with exploratory query processing.",Databases
3201,On Addressing Efficiency Concerns in Privacy Preserving Data Mining,"Data mining services require accurate input data for their results to be meaningful, but privacy concerns may influence users to provide spurious information. To encourage users to provide correct inputs, we recently proposed a data distortion scheme for association rule mining that simultaneously provides both privacy to the user and accuracy in the mining results. However, mining the distorted database can be orders of magnitude more time-consuming as compared to mining the original database. In this paper, we address this issue and demonstrate that by (a) generalizing the distortion process to perform symbol-specific distortion, (b) appropriately choosing the distortion parameters, and (c) applying a variety of optimizations in the reconstruction process, runtime efficiencies that are well within an order of magnitude of undistorted mining can be achieved.",Databases

  Manipulation Language","We define XPathLog as a Datalog-style extension of XPath. XPathLog provides a clear, declarative language for querying and manipulating XML whose perspectives are especially in XML data integration. In our characterization, the formal semantics is defined wrt. an edge-labeled graph-based model which covers the XML data model. We give a complete, logic-based characterization of XML data and the main language concept for XML, XPath. XPath-Logic extends the XPath language with variable bindings and embeds it into first-order logic. XPathLog is then the Horn fragment of XPath-Logic, providing a Datalog-style, rule-based language for querying and manipulating XML data. The model-theoretic semantics of XPath-Logic serves as the base of XPathLog as a logic-programming language, whereas also an equivalent answer-set semantics for evaluating XPathLog queries is given. In contrast to other approaches, the XPath syntax and semantics is also used for a declarative specification how the database should be updated: when used in rule heads, XPath filters are interpreted as specifications of elements and properties which should be added to the database.",Databases

In particular we consider several (partial) stable model semantics, previously defined for deductive rules, such as well-founded, max deterministic, unique total stable model, total stable model, and maximal stable model semantics. The semantics of an active program AP is given by first rewriting it into a deductive program P, then computing a model M defining the declarative semantics of P and, finally, applying `consistent' updates contained in M to the source database. The framework we propose permits a natural integration of deductive and active rules and can also be applied to queries with function symbols or to queries over infinite databases.",Databases
3204,On A Theory of Probabilistic Deductive Databases,"We propose a framework for modeling uncertainty where both belief and doubt can be given independent, first-class status. We adopt probability theory as the mathematical formalism for manipulating uncertainty. An agent can express the uncertainty in her knowledge about a piece of information in the form of a confidence level, consisting of a pair of intervals of probability, one for each of her belief and doubt. The space of confidence levels naturally leads to the notion of a trilattice, similar in spirit to Fitting's bilattices. Intuitively, thep oints in such a trilattice can be ordered according to truth, information, or precision. We develop a framework for probabilistic deductive databases by associating confidence levels with the facts and rules of a classical deductive database. While the trilattice structure offers a variety of choices for defining the semantics of probabilistic deductive databases, our choice of semantics is based on the truth-ordering, which we find to be closest to the classical framework for deductive databases. In addition to proposing a declarative semantics based on valuations and an equivalent semantics based on fixpoint theory, we also propose a proof procedure and prove it sound and complete. We show that while classical Datalog query programs have a polynomial time data complexity, certain query programs in the probabilistic deductive database framework do not even terminate on some input databases. We identify a large natural class of query programs of practical interest in our framework, and show that programs in this class possess polynomial time data complexity, i.e., not only do they terminate on every input database, they are guaranteed to do so in a number of steps polynomial in the input database size.",Databases

In our approach, preference queries are relational algebra or SQL queries that contain occurrences of the winnow operator (""find the most preferred tuples in a given relation"").   We present here a number of semantic optimization techniques applicable to preference queries. The techniques make use of integrity constraints, and make it possible to remove redundant occurrences of the winnow operator and to apply a more efficient algorithm for the computation of winnow. We also study the propagation of integrity constraints in the result of the winnow. We have identified necessary and sufficient conditions for the applicability of our techniques, and formulated those conditions as constraint satisfiability problems.",Databases

3209,"Extending the SDSS Batch Query System to the National Virtual
  Observatory Grid","The Sloan Digital Sky Survey science database is approaching 2TB. While the vast majority of queries normally execute in seconds or minutes, this interactive execution time can be disproportionately increased by a small fraction of queries that take hours or days to run; either because they require non-index scans of the largest tables or because they request very large result sets. In response to this, we added a multi-queue job submission and tracking system. The transfer of very large result sets from queries over the network is another serious problem. Statistics suggested that much of this data transfer is unnecessary; users would prefer to store results locally in order to allow further cross matching and filtering. To allow local analysis, we implemented a system that gives users their own personal database (MyDB) at the portal site. Users may transfer data to their MyDB, and then perform further analysis before extracting it to their own machine.   We intend to extend the MyDB and asynchronous query ideas to multiple NVO nodes. This implies development, in a distributed manner, of several features, which have been demonstrated for a single node in the SDSS Batch Query System (CasJobs). The generalization of asynchronous queries necessitates some form of MyDB storage as well as workflow tracking services on each node and coordination strategies among nodes.",Databases

Originally we chose an object-oriented database management system due to its data organization capabilities, platform independence, query performance and conceptual fit to the data. However, after using the object database for the first couple of years of the project, it soon began to fall short in terms of its query support and data mining performance. This was as much due to the inability of the database vendor to respond our demands for features and bug fixes as it was due to their failure to keep up with the rapid improvements in hardware performance, particularly faster RAID disk systems. In the end, we were forced to abandon the object database and migrate our data to a relational database. We describe below the technical issues that we faced with the object database and how and why we migrated to relational technology.",Databases
3212,Enhancing the expressive power of the U-Datalog language,"U-Datalog has been developed with the aim of providing a set-oriented logical update language, guaranteeing update parallelism in the context of a Datalog-like language. In U-Datalog, updates are expressed by introducing constraints (+p(X), to denote insertion, and [minus sign]p(X), to denote deletion) inside Datalog rules. A U-Datalog program can be interpreted as a CLP program. In this framework, a set of updates (constraints) is satisfiable if it does not represent an inconsistent theory, that is, it does not require the insertion and the deletion of the same fact. This approach resembles a very simple form of negation. However, on the other hand, U-Datalog does not provide any mechanism to explicitly deal with negative information, resulting in a language with limited expressive power. In this paper, we provide a semantics, based on stratification, handling the use of negated atoms in U-Datalog programs, and we show which problems arise in defining a compositional semantics.",Databases

Then, extended abduction, which was introduced by the same authors as a generalization of traditional abduction, is computed by the answer sets of update programs. Next, different types of updates, view updates and theory updates are characterized by abductive programs and computed by update programs. The task of consistency restoration is also realized as special cases of these updates. Each update problem is comparatively assessed from the computational complexity viewpoint. The result of this paper provides a uniform framework for different types of knowledge base updates, and each update is computed using existing procedures of logic programming.",Databases

3217,The Revolution In Database System Architecture,"Database system architectures are undergoing revolutionary changes. Algorithms and data are being unified by integrating programming languages with the database system. This gives an extensible object-relational system where non-procedural relational operators manipulate object sets. Coupled with this, each DBMS is now a web service. This has huge implications for how we structure applications. DBMSs are now object containers. Queues are the first objects to be added. These queues are the basis for transaction processing and workflow applica-tions. Future workflow systems are likely to be built on this core. Data cubes and online analytic processing are now baked into most DBMSs. Beyond that, DBMSs have a framework for data mining and machine learning algorithms. Decision trees, Bayes nets, clustering, and time series analysis are built in; new algorithms can be added. Text, temporal, and spatial data access methods, along with their probabilistic reasoning have been added to database systems. Allowing approximate and probabilistic answers is essential for many applications. Many believe that XML and xQuery will be the main data structure and access pattern. Database systems must accommodate that perspective.These changes mandate a much more dynamic query optimization strategy. Intelligence is moving to the periphery of the network. Each disk and each sensor will be a competent database machine. Relational algebra is a convenient way to program these systems.

3218,There Goes the Neighborhood: Relational Algebra for Spatial Data Search,"We explored ways of doing spatial search within a relational database: (1) hierarchical triangular mesh (a tessellation of the sphere), (2) a zoned bucketing system, and (3) representing areas as disjunctive-normal form constraints. Each of these approaches has merits. They all allow efficient point-in-region queries. A relational representation for regions allows Boolean operations among them and allows quick tests for point-in-region, regions-containing-point, and region-overlap. The speed of these algorithms is much improved by a zone and multi-scale zone-pyramid scheme. The approach has the virtue that the zone mechanism works well on B-Trees native to all SQL systems and integrates naturally with current query optimizers - rather than requiring a new spatial access method and concomitant query optimizer extensions.

In this paper, we present a novel notion of \emph{Streaming Processing Model} (\emph{SPM}) to evaluate a subset of XSLT programs on XML documents, especially large ones. With SPM, an XSLT processor can transform an XML source document to other formats without extra memory buffers required. Therefore, our approach can not only tackle large source documents, but also produce large results. We demonstrate with a performance study the advantages of the SPM approach. Experimental results clearly confirm that SPM improves XSLT evaluation typically 2 to 10 times better than the existing approaches. Moreover, the SPM approach also features high scalability.",Databases

Associated with each relation are two membership functions one is called truth-membership function $T$ which keeps track of the extent to which we believe the tuple is in the relation, another is called false-membership function which keeps track of the extent to which we believe that it is not in the relation. A paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relation is inconsistent if there exists one tuple $a$ such that $T(a) + F(a) > 1$. In order to handle inconsistent situation, we propose an operator called split to transform inconsistent paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relations into pseudo-consistent paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relations and do the set-theoretic and relation-theoretic operations on them and finally use another operator called combine to transform the result back to paraconsistent intuitionistic fuzzy relation. For this model, we define algebraic operators that are generalisations of the usual operators such as union, selection, join on fuzzy relations.

We define spatio-temporal queries to be computable mappings that are also generic, meaning that the result of a query may only depend to a limited extent on the actual internal representation of the spatio-temporal data. Genericity is defined as invariance under groups of geometric transformations that preserve certain characteristics of spatio-temporal data (e.g., collinearity, distance, velocity, acceleration, ...). These groups depend on the notions that are relevant in particular spatio-temporal database applications.   These transformations also have the distinctive property that they respect the monotone and unidirectional nature of time.   We investigate different genericity classes with respect to the constraint database model for spatio-temporal databases and we identify sound and complete languages for the first-order and the computable queries in these genericity classes. We distinguish between genericity determined by time-invariant transformations, genericity notions concerning physical quantities and genericity determined by time-dependent transformations.",Databases
3229,Theory and Practice of Transactional Method Caching,"Nowadays, tiered architectures are widely accepted for constructing large scale information systems. In this context application servers often form the bottleneck for a system's efficiency. An application server exposes an object oriented interface consisting of set of methods which are accessed by potentially remote clients. The idea of method caching is to store results of read-only method invocations with respect to the application server's interface on the client side. If the client invokes the same method with the same arguments again, the corresponding result can be taken from the cache without contacting the server. It has been shown that this approach can considerably improve a real world system's efficiency.   This paper extends the concept of method caching by addressing the case where clients wrap related method invocations in ACID transactions. Demarcating sequences of method calls in this way is supported by many important application server standards. In this context the paper presents an architecture, a theory and an efficient protocol for maintaining full transactional consistency and in particular serializability when using a method cache on the client side. In order to create a protocol for scheduling cached method results, the paper extends a classical transaction formalism. Based on this extension, a recovery protocol and an optimistic serializability protocol are derived. The latter one differs from traditional transactional cache protocols in many essential ways. An efficiency experiment validates the approach: Using the cache a system's performance and scalability are considerably improved.",Databases

In a number of applications, expiration times are known and can be assigned at insertion time. We present data structures and algorithms for online management of data tagged with expiration times. The algorithms are based on fully functional, persistent treaps, which are a combination of binary search trees with respect to a primary attribute and heaps with respect to a secondary attribute. The primary attribute implements primary keys, and the secondary attribute stores expiration times in a minimum heap, thus keeping a priority queue of tuples to expire. A detailed and comprehensive experimental study demonstrates the well-behavedness and scalability of the approach as well as its efficiency with respect to a number of competitors.",Databases

3232,Instance-Independent View Serializability for Semistructured Databases,"Semistructured databases require tailor-made concurrency control mechanisms since traditional solutions for the relational model have been shown to be inadequate. Such mechanisms need to take full advantage of the hierarchical structure of semistructured data, for instance allowing concurrent updates of subtrees of, or even individual elements in, XML documents. We present an approach for concurrency control which is document-independent in the sense that two schedules of semistructured transactions are considered equivalent if they are equivalent on all possible documents. We prove that it is decidable in polynomial time whether two given schedules in this framework are equivalent. This also solves the view serializability for semistructured schedules polynomially in the size of the schedule and exponentially in the number of transactions.",Databases
3233,HepToX: Heterogeneous Peer to Peer XML Databases,"We study a collection of heterogeneous XML databases maintaining similar and related information, exchanging data via a peer to peer overlay network. In this setting, a mediated global schema is unrealistic. Yet, users/applications wish to query the databases via one peer using its schema. We have recently developed HepToX, a P2P Heterogeneous XML database system. A key idea is that whenever a peer enters the system, it establishes an acquaintance with a small number of peer databases, possibly with different schema. The peer administrator provides correspondences between the local schema and the acquaintance schema using an informal and intuitive notation of arrows and boxes. We develop a novel algorithm that infers a set of precise mapping rules between the schemas from these visual annotations. We pin down a semantics of query translation given such mapping rules, and present a novel query translation algorithm for a simple but expressive fragment of XQuery, that employs the mapping rules in either direction. We show the translation algorithm is correct. Finally, we demonstrate the utility and scalability of our ideas and algorithms with a detailed set of experiments on top of the Emulab, a large scale P2P network emulation testbed.",Databases
3234,Database Reformulation with Integrity Constraints (extended abstract),"In this paper we study the problem of reducing the evaluation costs of queries on finite databases in presence of integrity constraints, by designing and materializing views. Given a database schema, a set of queries defined on the schema, a set of integrity constraints, and a storage limit, to find a solution to this problem means to find a set of views that satisfies the storage limit, provides equivalent rewritings of the queries under the constraints (this requirement is weaker than equivalence in the absence of constraints), and reduces the total costs of evaluating the queries. This problem, database reformulation, is important for many applications, including data warehousing and query optimization. We give complexity results and algorithms for database reformulation in presence of constraints, for conjunctive queries, views, and rewritings and for several types of constraints, including functional and inclusion dependencies. To obtain better complexity results, we introduce an unchase technique, which reduces the problem of query equivalence under constraints to equivalence in the absence of constraints without increasing query size.",Databases

The assigned number of enclosed cycles (the parameter of the problem) defines the maximum length of the desired FPs.

Consistent answers to queries wrt a set of ICs have been characterized as answers that can be obtained from every possible minimally repaired consistent version of the original database. In this paper we consider databases that contain null values and are also repaired, if necessary, using null values. For this purpose, we propose first a precise semantics for IC satisfaction in a database with null values that is compatible with the way null values are treated in commercial database management systems. Next, a precise notion of repair is introduced that privileges the introduction of null values when repairing foreign key constraints, in such a way that these new values do not create an infinite cycle of new inconsistencies. Finally, we analyze how to specify this kind of repairs of a database that contains null values using disjunctive logic programs with stable model semantics.",Databases

We introduce world-set decompositions (WSDs), a space-efficient formalism for representing any finite set of possible worlds over relational databases. WSDs are therefore a strong representation system for any relational query language. We study the problem of efficiently evaluating relational algebra queries on sets of worlds represented by WSDs. We also evaluate our technique experimentally in a large census data scenario and show that it is both scalable and efficient.",Databases

3246,Efficient Threshold Aggregation of Moving Objects,"Calculating aggregation operators of moving point objects, using time as a continuous variable, presents unique problems when querying for congestion in a moving and changing (or dynamic) query space. We present a set of congestion query operators, based on a threshold value, that estimate the following 5 aggregation operations in d-dimensions. 1) We call the count of point objects that intersect the dynamic query space during the query time interval, the CountRange. 2) We call the Maximum (or Minimum) congestion in the dynamic query space at any time during the query time interval, the MaxCount (or MinCount). 3) We call the sum of time that the dynamic query space is congested, the ThresholdSum. 4) We call the number of times that the dynamic query space is congested, the ThresholdCount. And 5) we call the average length of time of all the time intervals when the dynamic query space is congested, the ThresholdAverage. These operators rely on a novel approach to transforming the problem of selection based on position to a problem of selection based on a threshold. These operators can be used to predict concentrations of migrating birds that may carry disease such as Bird Flu and hence the information may be used to predict high risk areas. On a smaller scale, those operators are also applicable to maintaining safety in airplane operations. We present the theory of our estimation operators and provide algorithms for exact operators. The implementations of those operators, and experiments, which include data from more than 7500 queries, indicate that our estimation operators produce fast, efficient results with error under 5%.",Databases
3247,Reducing Order Enforcement Cost in Complex Query Plans,"Algorithms that exploit sort orders are widely used to implement joins, grouping, duplicate elimination and other set operations. Query optimizers traditionally deal with sort orders by using the notion of interesting orders. The number of interesting orders is unfortunately factorial in the number of participating attributes. Optimizer implementations use heuristics to prune the number of interesting orders, but the quality of the heuristics is unclear. Increasingly complex decision support queries and increasing use of covering indices, which provide multiple alternative sort orders for relations, motivate us to better address the problem of optimization with interesting orders.   We show that even a simplified version of optimization with sort orders is NP-hard and provide principled heuristics for choosing interesting orders. We have implemented the proposed techniques in a Volcano-style cost-based optimizer, and our performance study shows significant improvements in estimated cost. We also executed our plans on a widely used commercial database system, and on PostgreSQL, and found that actual execution times for our plans were significantly better than for plans generated by those systems in several cases.",Databases

These are conflicting goals. We use a definition of privacy that is derived from existing ones in the literature, which relates the a priori probability of a given tuple t, Pr(t), with the a posteriori probability, Pr(t | V), and propose a novel and quite practical definition for utility. Our main result is the following. Denoting n the size of I and m the size of the domain from which I was drawn (i.e. n < m) then: when the a priori probability is Pr(t) = Omega(n/sqrt(m)) for some t, there exists no useful anonymization algorithm, while when Pr(t) = O(n/m) for all tuples t, then we give a concrete anonymization algorithm that is both private and useful. Our algorithm is quite different from the k-anonymization algorithm studied intensively in the literature, and is based on random deletions and insertions to I.",Databases

3251,Fragmentation in Large Object Repositories,"Fragmentation leads to unpredictable and degraded application performance. While these problems have been studied in detail for desktop filesystem workloads, this study examines newer systems such as scalable object stores and multimedia repositories. Such systems use a get/put interface to store objects. In principle, databases and filesystems can support such applications efficiently, allowing system designers to focus on complexity, deployment cost and manageability. Although theoretical work proves that certain storage policies behave optimally for some workloads, these policies often behave poorly in practice. Most storage benchmarks focus on short-term behavior or do not measure fragmentation. We compare SQL Server to NTFS and find that fragmentation dominates performance when object sizes exceed 256KB-1MB. NTFS handles fragmentation better than SQL Server. Although the performance curves will vary with other systems and workloads, we expect the same interactions between fragmentation and free space to apply. It is well-known that fragmentation is related to the percentage free space. We found that the ratio of free space to object size also impacts performance. Surprisingly, in both systems, storing objects of a single size causes fragmentation, and changing the size of write requests affects fragmentation. These problems could be addressed with simple changes to the filesystem and database interfaces. It is our hope that an improved understanding of fragmentation will lead to predictable storage systems that require less maintenance after deployment.",Databases

In contrast, CondorJ2 employs a data-centric, 3-tier web-application architecture for all system functions (e.g., job submission, monitoring and scheduling; node configuration, monitoring and management, etc.) except for job execution. Employing a data-oriented approach allows the core challenge (i.e., managing and coordinating a large set of distributed computing resources) to be transformed from a relatively low-level systems problem into a more abstract, higher-level data management problem. Preliminary results suggest that CondorJ2's use of standard 3-tier software represents a significant step forward to the design and implementation of large clusters (1,000 to 10,000 nodes).",Databases
3260,"Data Cube: A Relational Aggregation Operator Generalizing Group-By,
  Cross-Tab, and Sub-Totals","Data analysis applications typically aggregate data across many dimensions looking for anomalies or unusual patterns. The SQL aggregate functions and the GROUP BY operator produce zero-dimensional or one-dimensional aggregates. Applications need the N-dimensional generalization of these operators. This paper defines that operator, called the data cube or simply cube. The cube operator generalizes the histogram, cross-tabulation, roll-up, drill-down, and sub-total constructs found in most report writers. The novelty is that cubes are relations. Consequently, the cube operator can be imbedded in more complex non-procedural data analysis programs. The cube operator treats each of the N aggregation attributes as a dimension of N-space. The aggregate of a particular set of attribute values is a point in this space. The set of points forms an N-dimensional cube. Super-aggregates are computed by aggregating the N-cube to lower dimensional spaces. This paper (1) explains the cube and roll-up operators, (2) shows how they fit in SQL, (3) explains how users can define new aggregate functions for cubes, and (4) discusses efficient techniques to compute the cube.

Queues are interesting databases with interesting concurrency control. It is best to build these mechanisms into a standard database system so other applications can use these interesting features. Queue systems need DBMS functionality. Queues need security, configuration, performance monitoring, recovery, and reorganization utilities. Database systems already have these features.

Our solution lies in the field of data warehouse auto-administration. In this framework, we propose an automatic index selection strategy. We exploit a data mining technique ; more precisely frequent itemset mining, in order to determine a set of candidate indexes from a given workload.

This selection is based on cost models that evaluate the cost of accessing data using views and the cost of storing these views.

  de données à objets","In object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multimedia databases or most XML databases, access patterns are not static, i.e., applications do not always access the same objects in the same order repeatedly. However, this has been the way these databases and associated optimisation techniques such as clustering have been evaluated up to now. This paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object evaluation framework (DOEF). DOEF accomplishes access pattern change by defining configurable styles of change. It is a preliminary prototype that has been designed to be open and fully extensible. Though originally designed for the object-oriented model, it can also be used within the object-relational model with few adaptations. Furthermore, new access pattern change models can be added too. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we conducted two different sets of experiments. In the first set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering algorithms. The results show that DOEF is effective at determining the adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern. They also led us to conclude that dynamic clustering algorithms can cope with moderate levels of access pattern change, but that performance rapidly degrades to be worse than no clustering when vigorous styles of access pattern change are applied. In the second set of experiments, we used DOEF to compare the performance of two different object stores: Platypus and SHORE.

  Simplicity","We present in this paper three dynamic clustering techniques for Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs). The first two, Dynamic, Statistical & Tunable Clustering (DSTC) and StatClust, exploit both comprehensive usage statistics and the inter-object reference graph. They are quite elaborate. However, they are also complex to implement and induce a high overhead. The third clustering technique, called Detection & Reclustering of Objects (DRO), is based on the same principles, but is much simpler to implement. These three clustering algorithm have been implemented in the Texas persistent object store and compared in terms of clustering efficiency (i.e., overall performance increase) and overhead using the Object Clustering Benchmark (OCB). The results obtained showed that DRO induced a lighter overhead while still achieving better overall performance.",Databases
3274,"VOODB: A Generic Discrete-Event Random Simulation Model to Evaluate the
  Performances of OODBs","Performance of object-oriented database systems (OODBs) is still an issue to both designers and users nowadays. The aim of this paper is to propose a generic discrete-event random simulation model, called VOODB, in order to evaluate the performances of OODBs in general, and the performances of optimization methods like clustering in particular. Such optimization methods undoubtedly improve the performances of OODBs. Yet, they also always induce some kind of overhead for the system. Therefore, it is important to evaluate their exact impact on the overall performances. VOODB has been designed as a generic discrete-event random simulation model by putting to use a modelling approach, and has been validated by simulating the behavior of the O2 OODB and the Texas persistent object store. Since our final objective is to compare object clustering algorithms, some experiments have also been conducted on the DSTC clustering technique, which is implemented in Texas. To validate VOODB, performance results obtained by simulation for a given experiment have been compared to the results obtained by benchmarking the real systems in the same conditions. Benchmarking and simulation performance evaluations have been observed to be consistent, so it appears that simulation can be a reliable approach to evaluate the performances of OODBs.",Databases

OCB is generic because its sample database may be customized to fit the databases introduced by the main existing benchmarks (e.g., OO1). OCB's current form is clustering-oriented because of its clustering-oriented workload, but it can be easily adapted to other purposes. Lastly, OCB's code is compact and easily portable. OCB has been implemented in a real system (Texas, running on a Sun workstation), in order to test a specific clustering policy called DSTC. A few results concerning this test are presented.",Databases

This methodology has been used to compare the performances of three clustering algorithms found in the literature (Cactis, CK and ORION) that we considered representative of the current research in the field of object clustering. The actual performance evaluation was performed using simulation. Simulation experiments we performed showed that the Cactis algorithm is better than the ORION algorithm and that the CK algorithm totally outperforms both other algorithms in terms of response time and clustering overhead.",Databases
3277,DWEB: A Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark,"Data warehouse architectural choices and optimization techniques are critical to decision support query performance. To facilitate these choices, the performance of the designed data warehouse must be assessed. This is usually done with the help of benchmarks, which can either help system users comparing the performances of different systems, or help system engineers testing the effect of various design choices. While the TPC standard decision support benchmarks address the first point, they are not tuneable enough to address the second one and fail to model different data warehouse schemas. By contrast, our Data Warehouse Engineering Benchmark (DWEB) allows to generate various ad-hoc synthetic data warehouses and workloads. DWEB is fully parameterized to fulfill data warehouse design needs. However, two levels of parameterization keep it relatively easy to tune. Finally, DWEB is implemented as a Java free software that can be interfaced with most existing relational database management systems. A sample usage of DWEB is also provided in this paper.",Databases
3278,DOEF: A Dynamic Object Evaluation Framework,"In object-oriented or object-relational databases such as multimedia databases or most XML databases, access patterns are not static, i.e., applications do not always access the same objects in the same order repeatedly. However, this has been the way these databases and associated optimisation techniques like clustering have been evaluated up to now. This paper opens up research regarding this issue by proposing a dynamic object evaluation framework (DOEF) that accomplishes access pattern change by defining configurable styles of change. This preliminary prototype has been designed to be open and fully extensible. To illustrate the capabilities of DOEF, we used it to compare the performances of four state of the art dynamic clustering algorithms. The results show that DOEF is indeed effective at determining the adaptability of each dynamic clustering algorithm to changes in access pattern.",Databases
3279,Decision tree modeling with relational views,"Data mining is a useful decision support technique that can be used to discover production rules in warehouses or corporate data. Data mining research has made much effort to apply various mining algorithms efficiently on large databases. However, a serious problem in their practical application is the long processing time of such algorithms. Nowadays, one of the key challenges is to integrate data mining methods within the framework of traditional database systems. Indeed, such implementations can take advantage of the efficiency provided by SQL engines. In this paper, we propose an integrating approach for decision trees within a classical database system. In other words, we try to discover knowledge from relational databases, in the form of production rules, via a procedure embedding SQL queries. The obtained decision tree is defined by successive, related relational views. Each view corresponds to a given population in the underlying decision tree. We selected the classical Induction Decision Tree (ID3) algorithm to build the decision tree. To prove that our implementation of ID3 works properly, we successfully compared the output of our procedure with the output of an existing and validated data mining software, SIPINA. Furthermore, since our approach is tuneable, it can be generalized to any other similar decision tree-based method.",Databases

Furthermore, the very schema definition provides first-rate metadata in our data warehousing context. At the conceptual level, a complex object is represented in UML. Our logical model is an XML schema that can be described with a DTD or the XML-Schema language. Eventually, we have designed a Java prototype that transforms our multiform input data into XML documents representing our physical model. Then, the XML documents we obtain are mapped into a relational database we view as an ODS (Operational Data Storage), whose content will have to be re-modeled in a multidimensional way to allow its storage in a star schema-based warehouse and, later, its analysis.",Databases

We propose in this paper a UML conceptual model for a complex object representing a superclass of any useful data source (databases, plain texts, HTML and XML documents, images, sounds, video clips...). The translation into a logical model is achieved with XML, which helps integrating all these diverse, heterogeneous data into a unified format, and whose schema definition provides first-rate metadata in our data warehousing context. Moreover, we benefit from XML's flexibility, extensibility and from the richness of the semi-structured data model, but we are still able to later map XML documents into a database if more structuring is needed.",Databases

However, in practice, the data publisher does not know what background knowledge the attacker possesses. Thus, it is important to consider the worst-case. In this paper, we initiate a formal study of worst-case background knowledge. We propose a language that can express any background knowledge about the data. We provide a polynomial time algorithm to measure the amount of disclosure of sensitive information in the worst case, given that the attacker has at most a specified number of pieces of information in this language. We also provide a method to efficiently sanitize the data so that the amount of disclosure in the worst case is less than a specified threshold.",Databases

The ability to represent large sets of possible instances (worlds) while supporting efficient storage and processing is an important challenge in this context. The recent formalism of world-set decompositions (WSDs) provides a space-efficient representation for uncertain data that also supports scalable processing. WSDs are complete for finite world-sets in that they can represent any finite set of possible worlds. For possibly infinite world-sets, we show that a natural generalization of WSDs precisely captures the expressive power of c-tables. We then show that several important decision problems are efficiently solvable on WSDs while they are NP-hard on c-tables. Finally, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for factorizing WSDs, i.e. an efficient algorithm for minimizing such representations.",Databases

Our goal is to provide an integrated view on biomedical information sources for the Health-e-Child project with the aim to overcome the lack of sufficient semantic-based reformulation techniques for querying distributed data sources. In particular, this paper examines the problem of query reformulation across biomedical data sources, based on merged ontologies and the underlying heterogeneous descriptions of the respective data sources.",Databases

Such problems have been addressed by classical data warehousing (i.e., applied to ""simple"" data). However, data warehousing approaches need to be adapted for complex data. In this paper, we first propose a precise, though open, definition of complex data. Then we present a general architecture framework for warehousing complex data. This architecture heavily relies on metadata and domain-related knowledge, and rests on the XML language, which helps storing data, metadata and domain-specific knowledge altogether, and facilitates communication between the various warehousing processes.",Databases

We also identify the class of summable queries, which can be efficiently evaluated by precomputing the overlay of two or more of the thematic layers involved in the query. We also sketch a language, denoted GISOLAP-QL, for expressing queries that involve GIS and OLAP features. In addition, we introduce Piet, an implementation of our proposal, that makes use of overlay precomputation for answering spatial queries (aggregate or not).

The second principle --""data complexity in names""-- is the basis for a system where data are described as complex objects and uniquely represented as a set of relations. Names of these relations and names of their attributes are combinations of names entered in specifications of the complex objects. Below, we consider the main properties of such a system.",Databases

We consider policies expressed in terms of annotated DTDs defining which operations are allowed or denied for the XML trees that are instances of the DTD. We show that consistency is decidable in PTIME for such policies and that consistent partial policies can be extended to unique ""least-privilege"" consistent total policies.

Our data model is capable of manipulating incomplete as well as inconsistent information. Fuzzy relation or intuitionistic fuzzy relation can only handle incomplete information. Associated with each relation are two membership functions one is called truth-membership function T which keeps track of the extent to which we believe the tuple is in the relation, another is called falsity-membership function F which keeps track of the extent to which we believe that it is not in the relation. A neutrosophic relation is inconsistent if there exists one tuple a such that T(a) + F(a) > 1 . In order to handle inconsistent situation, we propose an operator called ""split"" to transform inconsistent neutrosophic relations into pseudo-consistent neutrosophic relations and do the set-theoretic and relation-theoretic operations on them and finally use another operator called ""combine"" to transform the result back to neutrosophic relation. For this data model, we define algebraic operators that are generalizations of the usual operators such as intersection, union, selection, join on fuzzy relations.

While the optimization of general user-defined recursive functions in XQuery appears elusive, we will describe how inflationary fixed points can be efficiently evaluated, provided that the recursive XQuery expressions exhibit a distributivity property.

This model is based on the formalism of nested ordered sets which uses inclusion relation to produce hierarchical structure of sets and ordering relation to produce multi-dimensional structure among its elements. Nested ordered set is defined as an ordered set where an each element can be itself an ordered set. Ordering relation in CoM is used to define data semantics and operations with data such as projection and de-projection. This data model can be applied to very different problems and the paper describes some its uses such grouping with aggregation and multi-dimensional analysis.,Databases
3301,Principles of the Concept-Oriented Data Model,"In the paper a new approach to data representation and manipulation is described, which is called the concept-oriented data model (CODM). It is supposed that items represent data units, which are stored in concepts. A concept is a combination of superconcepts, which determine the concept's dimensionality or properties. An item is a combination of superitems taken by one from all the superconcepts. An item stores a combination of references to its superitems. The references implement inclusion relation or attribute-value relation among items. A concept-oriented database is defined by its concept structure called syntax or schema and its item structure called semantics. The model defines formal transformations of syntax and semantics including the canonical semantics where all concepts are merged and the data semantics is represented by one set of items. The concept-oriented data model treats relations as subconcepts where items are instances of the relations. Multi-valued attributes are defined via subconcepts as a view on the database semantics rather than as a built-in mechanism. The model includes concept-oriented query language, which is based on collection manipulations. It also has such mechanisms as aggregation and inference based on semantics propagation through the database schema.",Databases

Both effects contribute to preserve scalability as the number of databases and transactions increase. Our algorithm ensures serializability, and is live and safe in spite of faults.",Databases

  Transaction Data","Mining frequent itemsets is a popular method for finding associated items in databases. For this method, support, the co-occurrence frequency of the items which form an association, is used as the primary indicator of the associations's significance. A single user-specified support threshold is used to decided if associations should be further investigated. Support has some known problems with rare items, favors shorter itemsets and sometimes produces misleading associations.   In this paper we develop a novel model-based frequency constraint as an alternative to a single, user-specified minimum support. The constraint utilizes knowledge of the process generating transaction data by applying a simple stochastic mixture model (the NB model) which allows for transaction data's typically highly skewed item frequency distribution. A user-specified precision threshold is used together with the model to find local frequency thresholds for groups of itemsets. Based on the constraint we develop the notion of NB-frequent itemsets and adapt a mining algorithm to find all NB-frequent itemsets in a database. In experiments with publicly available transaction databases we show that the new constraint provides improvements over a single minimum support threshold and that the precision threshold is more robust and easier to set and interpret by the user.",Databases

Bitmaps can be compressed to reduce input/output costs and minimize CPU usage. The most efficient compression techniques are based on run-length encoding (RLE), such as Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) compression. This type of compression accelerates logical operations (AND, OR) over the bitmaps. However, run-length encoding is sensitive to the order of the facts. Thus, we propose to sort the fact tables. We review lexicographic, Gray-code, and block-wise sorting. We found that a lexicographic sort improves compression--sometimes generating indexes twice as small--and make indexes several times faster. While sorting takes time, this is partially offset by the fact that it is faster to index a sorted table. Column order is significant: it is generally preferable to put the columns having more distinct values at the beginning. A block-wise sort is much less efficient than a full sort. Moreover, we found that Gray-code sorting is not better than lexicographic sorting when using word-aligned compression.",Databases

Similar to their deterministic relation counterparts, such compact probabilistic data synopses can form the foundation for human understanding and interactive data exploration, probabilistic query planning and optimization, and fast approximate query processing in probabilistic database systems.   In this paper, we introduce definitions and algorithms for building histogram- and wavelet-based synopses on probabilistic data. The core problem is to choose a set of histogram bucket boundaries or wavelet coefficients to optimize the accuracy of the approximate representation of a collection of probabilistic tuples under a given error metric. For a variety of different error metrics, we devise efficient algorithms that construct optimal or near optimal B-term histogram and wavelet synopses. This requires careful analysis of the structure of the probability distributions, and novel extensions of known dynamic-programming-based techniques for the deterministic domain. Our experiments show that this approach clearly outperforms simple ideas, such as building summaries for samples drawn from the data distribution, while taking equal or less time.",Databases

DescribeX supports the construction of heterogeneous summaries where different document elements sharing a common structure can be declaratively defined and refined by means of path regular expressions on axes, or axis path regular expression (AxPREs). DescribeX can significantly help in the understanding of both the structure of complex, heterogeneous XML collections and the behaviour of XPath queries evaluated on them.   Experimental results demonstrate the scalability of DescribeX summary refinements and stabilizations (the key enablers for tailoring summaries) with multi-gigabyte web collections. A comparative study suggests that using a DescribeX summary created from a given workload can produce query evaluation times orders of magnitude better than using existing summaries. DescribeX's light-weight approach of combining summaries with a file-at-a-time XPath processor can be a very competitive alternative, in terms of performance, to conventional fully-fledged XML query engines that provide DB-like functionality such as security, transaction processing, and native storage.",Databases

3315,A Logical Model and Data Placement Strategies for MEMS Storage Devices,"MEMS storage devices are new non-volatile secondary storages that have outstanding advantages over magnetic disks. MEMS storage devices, however, are much different from magnetic disks in the structure and access characteristics. They have thousands of heads called probe tips and provide the following two major access facilities: (1) flexibility: freely selecting a set of probe tips for accessing data, (2) parallelism: simultaneously reading and writing data with the set of probe tips selected. Due to these characteristics, it is nontrivial to find data placements that fully utilize the capability of MEMS storage devices. In this paper, we propose a simple logical model called the Region-Sector (RS) model that abstracts major characteristics affecting data retrieval performance, such as flexibility and parallelism, from the physical MEMS storage model. We also suggest heuristic data placement strategies based on the RS model and derive new data placements for relational data and two-dimensional spatial data by using those strategies. Experimental results show that the proposed data placements improve the data retrieval performance by up to 4.0 times for relational data and by up to 4.8 times for two-dimensional spatial data of approximately 320 Mbytes compared with those of existing data placements. Further, these improvements are expected to be more marked as the database size grows.",Databases

  Indexes","Bitmap indexes must be compressed to reduce input/output costs and minimize CPU usage. To accelerate logical operations (AND, OR, XOR) over bitmaps, we use techniques based on run-length encoding (RLE), such as Word-Aligned Hybrid (WAH) compression. These techniques are sensitive to the order of the rows: a simple lexicographical sort can divide the index size by 9 and make indexes several times faster. We investigate reordering heuristics based on computed attribute-value histograms. Simply permuting the columns of the table based on these histograms can increase the sorting efficiency by 40%.",Databases

Current approaches restrict the expressiveness of bids in order to achieve fast winner determination, which is the problem of allocating slots to advertisers so as to maximize the expected revenue given the advertisers' bids. The goal of our work is to permit more expressive bidding, thus allowing advertisers to achieve complex advertising goals, while still providing fast and scalable techniques for winner determination.",Databases
3318,Consistent Query Answers in the Presence of Universal Constraints,"The framework of consistent query answers and repairs has been introduced to alleviate the impact of inconsistent data on the answers to a query. A repair is a minimally different consistent instance and an answer is consistent if it is present in every repair. In this article we study the complexity of consistent query answers and repair checking in the presence of universal constraints.   We propose an extended version of the conflict hypergraph which allows to capture all repairs w.r.t. a set of universal constraints. We show that repair checking is in PTIME for the class of full tuple-generating dependencies and denial constraints, and we present a polynomial repair algorithm. This algorithm is sound, i.e. always produces a repair, but also complete, i.e. every repair can be constructed. Next, we present a polynomial-time algorithm computing consistent answers to ground quantifier-free queries in the presence of denial constraints, join dependencies, and acyclic full-tuple generating dependencies. Finally, we show that extending the class of constraints leads to intractability. For arbitrary full tuple-generating dependencies consistent query answering becomes coNP-complete. For arbitrary universal constraints consistent query answering is \Pi_2^p-complete and repair checking coNP-complete.",Databases

In this paper, we present an automatic, dynamic index selection method for data warehouses that is based on incremental frequent itemset mining from a given query workload. The main advantage of this approach is that it helps update the set of selected indexes when workload evolves instead of recreating it from scratch. Preliminary experimental results illustrate the efficiency of this approach, both in terms of performance enhancement and overhead.",Databases

3324,Frequent itemsets mining for database auto-administration,"With the wide development of databases in general and data warehouses in particular, it is important to reduce the tasks that a database administrator must perform manually. The aim of auto-administrative systems is to administrate and adapt themselves automatically without loss (or even with a gain) in performance. The idea of using data mining techniques to extract useful knowledge for administration from the data themselves has existed for some years. However, little research has been achieved. This idea nevertheless remains a very promising approach, notably in the field of data warehousing, where queries are very heterogeneous and cannot be interpreted easily. The aim of this study is to search for a way of extracting useful knowledge from stored data themselves to automatically apply performance optimization techniques, and more particularly indexing techniques. We have designed a tool that extracts frequent itemsets from a given workload to compute an index configuration that helps optimizing data access time. The experiments we performed showed that the index configurations generated by our tool allowed performance gains of 15% to 25% on a test database and a test data warehouse.",Databases

To help define a formal framework and allow much-needed performance optimizations on analytical queries expressed in XQuery, having an algebra at one's disposal is desirable. However, XOLAP approaches and algebras from the literature still largely rely on the relational model and/or only feature a small number of OLAP operators.

Compiling nested expressions of the fully compositional XQuery language, however, yields odd algebraic plan shapes featuring scattered distributions of join operators that currently overwhelm commercial SQL query optimizers.   This work rewrites such plans before submission to the relational database back-end. Once cast into the shape of join graphs, we have found off-the-shelf relational query optimizers--the B-tree indexing subsystem and join tree planner, in particular--to cope and even be autonomously capable of ""reinventing"" advanced processing strategies that have originally been devised specifically for the XQuery domain, e.g., XPath step reordering, axis reversal, and path stitching. Performance assessments provide evidence that relational query engines are among the most versatile and efficient XQuery processors readily available today.",Databases
3328,Consensus Answers for Queries over Probabilistic Databases,"We address the problem of finding a ""best"" deterministic query answer to a query over a probabilistic database. For this purpose, we propose the notion of a consensus world (or a consensus answer) which is a deterministic world (answer) that minimizes the expected distance to the possible worlds (answers). This problem can be seen as a generalization of the well-studied inconsistent information aggregation problems (e.g. rank aggregation) to probabilistic databases. We consider this problem for various types of queries including SPJ queries, \Topk queries, group-by aggregate queries, and clustering. For different distance metrics, we obtain polynomial time optimal or approximation algorithms for computing the consensus answers (or prove NP-hardness). Most of our results are for a general probabilistic database model, called {\em and/xor tree model}, which significantly generalizes previous probabilistic database models like x-tuples and block-independent disjoint models, and is of independent interest.",Databases
3329,Equivalence of SQL Queries in Presence of Embedded Dependencies,"We consider the problem of finding equivalent minimal-size reformulations of SQL queries in presence of embedded dependencies [1]. Our focus is on select-project-join (SPJ) queries with equality comparisons, also known as safe conjunctive (CQ) queries, possibly with grouping and aggregation. For SPJ queries, the semantics of the SQL standard treat query answers as multisets (a.k.a. bags), whereas the stored relations may be treated either as sets, which is called bag-set semantics for query evaluation, or as bags, which is called bag semantics. (Under set semantics, both query answers and stored relations are treated as sets.)   In the context of the above Query-Reformulation Problem, we develop a comprehensive framework for equivalence of CQ queries under bag and bag-set semantics in presence of embedded dependencies, and make a number of conceptual and technical contributions. Specifically, we develop equivalence tests for CQ queries in presence of arbitrary sets of embedded dependencies under bag and bag-set semantics, under the condition that chase [9] under set semantics (set-chase) on the inputs terminates. We also present equivalence tests for aggregate CQ queries in presence of embedded dependencies. We use our equivalence tests to develop sound and complete (whenever set-chase on the inputs terminates) algorithms for solving instances of the Query-Reformulation Problem with CQ queries under each of bag and bag-set semantics, as well as for instances of the problem with aggregate queries.",Databases

In this line, we develop two novel termination conditions for the chase.

3335,Concept-Oriented Model and Query Language,"We describe a new approach to data modeling, called the concept-oriented model (COM), and a novel concept-oriented query language (COQL). The model is based on three principles: duality principle postulates that any element is a couple consisting of one identity and one entity, inclusion principle postulates that any element has a super-element, and order principle assumes that any element has a number of greater elements within a partially ordered set. Concept-oriented query language is based on a new data modeling construct, called concept, inclusion relation between concepts, and concept partial ordering in which greater concepts are represented by their field types. It is demonstrated how COM and COQL can be used to solve three general data modeling tasks: logical navigation, multidimensional analysis and inference. Logical navigation is based on two operations of projection and de-projection. Multidimensional analysis uses product operation for producing a cube from level concepts chosen along the chosen dimension paths. Inference is defined as a two-step procedure where input constraints are first propagated downwards using de-projection and then the constrained result is propagated upwards using projection.",Databases

Its practicability, however, is limited by the fact that - for an arbitrary set of constraints - it might not terminate; even worse, chase termination is an undecidable problem in general. In response, the database community has proposed sufficient restrictions on top of the constraints that guarantee chase termination on any database instance. In this paper, we propose a novel sufficient termination condition, called inductive restriction, which strictly generalizes previous conditions, but can be checked as efficiently. Furthermore, we motivate and study the problem of data-dependent chase termination and, as a key result, present sufficient termination conditions w.r.t. fixed instances. They are strictly more general than inductive restriction and might guarantee termination although the chase does not terminate in the general case.",Databases

The main original part of this work consisted in implementation of the hyperset Delta query language to semi-structured databases, including worked example queries. In fact, the goal was to demonstrate the practical details of this approach and language. The required development of an extended, practical version of the language based on the existing theoretical version, and the corresponding operational semantics. Here we present detailed description of the most essential steps of the implementation. Another crucial problem for this approach was to demonstrate how to deal in reality with the concept of the equality relation between (hyper)sets, which is computationally realised by the bisimulation relation. In fact, this expensive procedure, especially in the case of distributed semi-structured data, required some additional theoretical considerations and practical suggestions for efficient implementation.

A laconic schema mapping is a schema mapping for which the canonical universal solution is the core universal solution. We give a procedure by which every schema mapping specified by FO s-t tgds can be turned into a laconic schema mapping specified by FO s-t tgds that may refer to a linear order on the domain of the source instance.

First, we formally define the measures, support and confidence, for evaluating utility of mds in the given database instance. Then, we study the discovery of mds with certain utility requirements of support and confidence. Exact algorithms are developed, together with pruning strategies to improve the time performance. Since the exact algorithm has to traverse all the data during the computation, we propose an approximate solution which only use some of the data. A bound of relative errors introduced by the approximation is also developed. Finally, our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed methods.",Databases

The process is fundamentally cooperative and gives users significant control over how mappings are repaired. An additional advantage of our model is that mapping cycles can be permitted without compromising correctness.   We investigate potential harmful interference between updates in our model; we introduce two appropriate notions of serializability that avoid such interference if enforced. The first is very general and related to classical final-state serializability; the second is more restrictive but highly practical and related to conflict-serializability. We present an algorithm to enforce the latter notion. Our algorithm is an optimistic one, and as such may sometimes require updates to be aborted.

3345,"Progressive Processing of Continuous Range Queries in Hierarchical
  Wireless Sensor Networks","In this paper, we study the problem of processing continuous range queries in a hierarchical wireless sensor network. Contrasted with the traditional approach of building networks in a ""flat"" structure using sensor devices of the same capability, the hierarchical approach deploys devices of higher capability in a higher tier, i.e., a tier closer to the server. While query processing in flat sensor networks has been widely studied, the study on query processing in hierarchical sensor networks has been inadequate. In wireless sensor networks, the main costs that should be considered are the energy for sending data and the storage for storing queries. There is a trade-off between these two costs. Based on this, we first propose a progressive processing method that effectively processes a large number of continuous range queries in hierarchical sensor networks. The proposed method uses the query merging technique proposed by Xiang et al. as the basis and additionally considers the trade-off between the two costs. More specifically, it works toward reducing the storage cost at lower-tier nodes by merging more queries, and toward reducing the energy cost at higher-tier nodes by merging fewer queries (thereby reducing ""false alarms""). We then present how to build a hierarchical sensor network that is optimal with respect to the weighted sum of the two costs. It allows for a cost-based systematic control of the trade-off based on the relative importance between the storage and energy in a given network environment and application. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a near-optimal control between the storage and energy and reduces the cost by 0.989~84.995 times compared with the cost achieved using the flat (i.e., non-hierarchical) setup as in the work by Xiang et al.",Databases

The study of Sequential patterns is an important data mining problem due to its wide applications to real world time dependent databases. Sequential patterns are inter-event patterns ordered over a time-period associated with specific objects under study. Analysis and discovery of frequent sequential patterns over a predetermined time-period are interesting data mining results, and can aid in decision support in many enterprise applications. The problem of sequential pattern mining poses computational challenges as a long frequent sequence contains enormous number of frequent subsequences. Also useful results depend on the right choice of event window. In this paper, we have studied the problem of sequential pattern mining through two perspectives, one the computational aspect of the problem and the other is incorporation and adjustability of time constraint. We have used Indiscernibility relation from theory of rough sets to partition the search space of sequential patterns and have proposed a novel algorithm that allows previsualization of patterns and allows adjustment of time constraint prior to execution of mining task.

3348,Why Did My Query Slow Down?,"Many enterprise environments have databases running on network-attached server-storage infrastructure (referred to as Storage Area Networks or SANs). Both the database and the SAN are complex systems that need their own separate administrative teams. This paper puts forth the vision of an innovative management framework to simplify administrative tasks that require an in-depth understanding of both the database and the SAN. As a concrete instance, we consider the task of diagnosing the slowdown in performance of a database query that is executed multiple times (e.g., in a periodic report-generation setting). This task is very challenging because the space of possible causes includes problems specific to the database, problems specific to the SAN, and problems that arise due to interactions between the two systems. In addition, the monitoring data available from these systems can be noisy.   We describe the design of DIADS which is an integrated diagnosis tool for database and SAN administrators. DIADS generates and uses a powerful abstraction called Annotated Plan Graphs (APGs) that ties together the execution path of queries in the database and the SAN. Using an innovative workflow that combines domain-specific knowledge with machine-learning techniques, DIADS was applied successfully to diagnose query slowdowns caused by complex combinations of events across a PostgreSQL database and a production SAN.",Databases

Unfortunately, determining the best column order is NP-hard. For many cases, we prove that the number of runs in table columns is minimized if we sort columns by increasing cardinality.

  Scientific Databases","Workloads that comb through vast amounts of data are gaining importance in the sciences. These workloads consist of ""needle in a haystack"" queries that are long running and data intensive so that query throughput limits performance. To maximize throughput for data-intensive queries, we put forth LifeRaft: a query processing system that batches queries with overlapping data requirements. Rather than scheduling queries in arrival order, LifeRaft executes queries concurrently against an ordering of the data that maximizes data sharing among queries. This decreases I/O and increases cache utility. However, such batch processing can increase query response time by starving interactive workloads. LifeRaft addresses starvation using techniques inspired by head scheduling in disk drives. Depending upon the workload saturation and queuing times, the system adaptively and incrementally trades-off processing queries in arrival order and data-driven batch processing. Evaluating LifeRaft in the SkyQuery federation of astronomy databases reveals a two-fold improvement in query throughput.",Databases

Despite the overhead and inadequacy of generic database systems in handling array data and numerical computation, RIOT-DB significantly outperforms R in many large-data scenarios, thanks to a suite of high-level, inter-operation optimizations that integrate seamlessly into R. While many techniques in RIOT are inspired by databases (and, for RIOT-DB, realized by a database system), RIOT users are insulated from anything database related.

In this paper we approach this issue by considering energy consumption as a first-class performance goal for query processing in a DBMS. We present two concrete techniques that can be used by a DBMS to directly manage the energy consumption. Both techniques trade energy consumption for performance. The first technique, called PVC, leverages the ability of modern processors to execute at lower processor voltage and frequency. The second technique, called QED, uses query aggregation to leverage common components of queries in a workload. Using experiments run on a commercial DBMS and MySQL, we show that PVC can reduce the processor energy consumption by 49% of the original consumption while increasing the response time by only 3%. On MySQL, PVC can reduce energy consumption by 20% with a response time penalty of only 6%. For simple selection queries with no predicate overlap, we show that QED can be used to gracefully trade response time for energy, reducing energy consumption by 54% for a 43% increase in average response time. In this paper we also highlight some research issues in the emerging area of energy-efficient data processing.",Databases
3355,The Role of Schema Matching in Large Enterprises,"To date, the principal use case for schema matching research has been as a precursor for code generation, i.e., constructing mappings between schema elements with the end goal of data transfer. In this paper, we argue that schema matching plays valuable roles independent of mapping construction, especially as schemata grow to industrial scales. Specifically, in large enterprises human decision makers and planners are often the immediate consumer of information derived from schema matchers, instead of schema mapping tools. We list a set of real application areas illustrating this role for schema matching, and then present our experiences tackling a customer problem in one of these areas. We describe the matcher used, where the tool was effective, where it fell short, and our lessons learned about how well current schema matching technology is suited for use in large enterprises. Finally, we suggest a new agenda for schema matching research based on these experiences.",Databases
3356,Search Driven Analysis of Heterogenous XML Data,"Analytical processing on XML repositories is usually enabled by designing complex data transformations that shred the documents into a common data warehousing schema. This can be very time-consuming and costly, especially if the underlying XML data has a lot of variety in structure, and only a subset of attributes constitutes meaningful dimensions and facts. Today, there is no tool to explore an XML data set, discover interesting attributes, dimensions and facts, and rapidly prototype an OLAP solution.   In this paper, we propose a system, called SEDA that enables users to start with simple keyword-style querying, and interactively refine the query based on result summaries. SEDA then maps query results onto a set of known, or newly created, facts and dimensions, and derives a star schema and its instantiation to be fed into an off-the-shelf OLAP tool, for further analysis.",Databases
3357,Capturing Data Uncertainty in High-Volume Stream Processing,"We present the design and development of a data stream system that captures data uncertainty from data collection to query processing to final result generation. Our system focuses on data that is naturally modeled as continuous random variables. For such data, our system employs an approach grounded in probability and statistical theory to capture data uncertainty and integrates this approach into high-volume stream processing. The first component of our system captures uncertainty of raw data streams from sensing devices. Since such raw streams can be highly noisy and may not carry sufficient information for query processing, our system employs probabilistic models of the data generation process and stream-speed inference to transform raw data into a desired format with an uncertainty metric. The second component captures uncertainty as data propagates through query operators. To efficiently quantify result uncertainty of a query operator, we explore a variety of techniques based on probability and statistical theory to compute the result distribution at stream speed. We are currently working with a group of scientists to evaluate our system using traces collected from the domains of (and eventually in the real systems for) hazardous weather monitoring and object tracking and monitoring.",Databases
3358,A Case for A Collaborative Query Management System,"Over the past 40 years, database management systems (DBMSs) have evolved to provide a sophisticated variety of data management capabilities. At the same time, tools for managing queries over the data have remained relatively primitive. One reason for this is that queries are typically issued through applications. They are thus debugged once and re-used repeatedly. This mode of interaction, however, is changing. As scientists (and others) store and share increasingly large volumes of data in data centers, they need the ability to analyze the data by issuing exploratory queries. In this paper, we argue that, in these new settings, data management systems must provide powerful query management capabilities, from query browsing to automatic query recommendations. We first discuss the requirements for a collaborative query management system. We outline an early system architecture and discuss the many research challenges associated with building such an engine.",Databases
3359,"The Case for RodentStore, an Adaptive, Declarative Storage System","Recent excitement in the database community surrounding new applications?analytic, scientific, graph, geospatial, etc.?has led to an explosion in research on database storage systems. New storage systems are vital to the database community, as they are at the heart of making database systems perform well in new application domains. Unfortunately, each such system also represents a substantial engineering effort including a great deal of duplication of mechanisms for features such as transactions and caching. In this paper, we make the case for RodentStore, an adaptive and declarative storage system providing a high-level interface for describing the physical representation of data. Specifically, RodentStore uses a declarative storage algebra whereby administrators (or database design tools) specify how a logical schema should be grouped into collections of rows, columns, and/or arrays, and the order in which those groups should be laid out on disk. We describe the key operators and types of our algebra, outline the general architecture of RodentStore, which interprets algebraic expressions to generate a physical representation of the data, and describe the interface between RodentStore and other parts of a database system, such as the query optimizer and executor. We provide a case study of the potential use of RodentStore in representing dense geospatial data collected from a mobile sensor network, showing the ease with which different storage layouts can be expressed using some of our algebraic constructs and the potential performance gains that a RodentStore-built storage system can offer.",Databases

The content that our system exposes contributes to more than 1000 search queries per-second and spans over 50 languages and hundreds of domains. The Deep Web has long been acknowledged to be a major source of structured data on the web, and hence accessing Deep-Web content has long been a problem of interest in the data management community. In this paper, we report on where we believe the Deep Web provides value and where it does not. We contrast two very different approaches to exposing Deep-Web content -- the surfacing approach that we used, and the virtual integration approach that has often been pursued in the data management literature. We emphasize where the values of each of the two approaches lie and caution against potential pitfalls. We outline important areas of future research and, in particular, emphasize the value that can be derived from analyzing large collections of potentially disparate structured data on the web.",Databases
3362,"Inter-Operator Feedback in Data Stream Management Systems via
  Punctuation","High-volume, high-speed data streams may overwhelm the capabilities of stream processing systems; techniques such as data prioritization, avoidance of unnecessary processing and on-demand result production may be necessary to reduce processing requirements. However, the dynamic nature of data streams, in terms of both rate and content, makes the application of such techniques challenging. Such techniques have been addressed in the context of static and centralized query optimization; however, they have not been fully addressed for data stream management systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework that supports prioritization, avoidance of unnecessary work, and on-demand result production over distributed, unreliable, bursty, disordered data sources, typical of many data streams. We propose a form of inter-operator feedback, which flows against the stream direction, to communicate the information needed to enable execution of these techniques. This feedback leverages punctuations to describe the subsets of interest. We identify potential sources of feedback information, characterize new types of punctuation to support feedback, and describe the roles of producers, exploiters, and relayers of feedback that query operators may implement. We present initial experimental observations using the NiagaraST data-stream system.",Databases
3363,Reducing Network Traffic in Unstructured P2P Systems Using Top-k Queries,"A major problem of unstructured P2P systems is their heavy network traffic. This is caused mainly by high numbers of query answers, many of which are irrelevant for users. One solution to this problem is to use Top-k queries whereby the user can specify a limited number (k) of the most relevant answers. In this paper, we present FD, a (Fully Distributed) framework for executing Top-k queries in unstructured P2P systems, with the objective of reducing network traffic. FD consists of a family of algorithms that are simple but effec-tive. FD is completely distributed, does not depend on the existence of certain peers, and addresses the volatility of peers during query execution. We vali-dated FD through implementation over a 64-node cluster and simulation using the BRITE topology generator and SimJava. Our performance evaluation shows that FD can achieve major performance gains in terms of communication and response time.",Databases
3364,Personal Information Databases,"One of the most important aspects of security organization is to establish a framework to identify security significant points where policies and procedures are declared. The (information) security infrastructure comprises entities, processes, and technology. All are participants in handling information, which is the item that needs to be protected. Privacy and security information technology is a critical and unmet need in the management of personal information. This paper proposes concepts and technologies for management of personal information. Two different types of information can be distinguished: personal information and nonpersonal information. Personal information can be either personal identifiable information (PII), or nonidentifiable information (NII). Security, policy, and technical requirements can be based on this distinction. At the conceptual level, PII is defined and formalized by propositions over infons (discrete pieces of information) that specify transformations in PII and NII. PII is categorized into simple infons that reflect the proprietor s aspects, relationships with objects, and relationships with other proprietors. The proprietor is the identified person about whom the information is communicated. The paper proposes a database organization that focuses on the PII spheres of proprietors. At the design level, the paper describes databases of personal identifiable information built exclusively for this type of information, with their own conceptual scheme, system management, and physical structure.",Databases
3365,Clustering with Obstacles in Spatial Databases,"Clustering large spatial databases is an important problem, which tries to find the densely populated regions in a spatial area to be used in data mining, knowledge discovery, or efficient information retrieval. However most algorithms have ignored the fact that physical obstacles such as rivers, lakes, and highways exist in the real world and could thus affect the result of the clustering. In this paper, we propose CPO, an efficient clustering technique to solve the problem of clustering in the presence of obstacles. The proposed algorithm divides the spatial area into rectangular cells. Each cell is associated with statistical information used to label the cell as dense or non-dense. It also labels each cell as obstructed (i.e. intersects any obstacle) or nonobstructed. For each obstructed cell, the algorithm finds a number of non-obstructed sub-cells. Then it finds the dense regions of non-obstructed cells or sub-cells by a breadthfirst search as the required clusters with a center to each region.",Databases

3367,Differential Privacy via Wavelet Transforms,"Privacy preserving data publishing has attracted considerable research interest in recent years. Among the existing solutions, {\em $\epsilon$-differential privacy} provides one of the strongest privacy guarantees. Existing data publishing methods that achieve $\epsilon$-differential privacy, however, offer little data utility. In particular, if the output dataset is used to answer count queries, the noise in the query answers can be proportional to the number of tuples in the data, which renders the results useless.   In this paper, we develop a data publishing technique that ensures $\epsilon$-differential privacy while providing accurate answers for {\em range-count queries}, i.e., count queries where the predicate on each attribute is a range. The core of our solution is a framework that applies {\em wavelet transforms} on the data before adding noise to it. We present instantiations of the proposed framework for both ordinal and nominal data, and we provide a theoretical analysis on their privacy and utility guarantees. In an extensive experimental study on both real and synthetic data, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution.",Databases

In this paper, we review the proposals for the semantics of these crucial operators. For each of these proposals, we concentrate on the three following problems: the definition of the semantics of the operator, the language needed to express the operator, and the algorithmic issues associated to the problem of computing the operator. It should be pointed out that we primarily consider the formalization of schema mappings introduced in the work on data exchange. In particular, when studying the problem of computing the composition and inverse of a schema mapping, we will be mostly interested in computing these operators for mappings specified by source-to-target tuple-generating dependencies.",Databases
3369,Optimization and Evaluation of Nested Queries and Procedures,"Many database applications perform complex data retrieval and update tasks. Nested queries, and queries that invoke user-defined functions, which are written using a mix of procedural and SQL constructs, are often used in such applications. A straight-forward evaluation of such queries involves repeated execution of parameterized sub-queries or blocks containing queries and procedural code.   An important problem that arises while optimizing nested queries as well as queries with joins, aggregates and set operations is the problem of finding an optimal sort order from a factorial number of possible sort orders. We show that even a special case of this problem is NP-Hard, and present practical heuristics that are effective and easy to incorporate in existing query optimizers.   We also consider iterative execution of queries and updates inside complex procedural blocks such as user-defined functions and stored procedures. Parameter batching is an important means of improving performance as it enables set-orientated processing. The key challenge to parameter batching lies in rewriting a given procedure/function to process a batch of parameter values. We propose a solution, based on program analysis and rewrite rules, to automate the generation of batched forms of procedures and replace iterative database calls within imperative loops with a single call to the batched form.   We present experimental results for the proposed techniques, and the results show significant gains in performance.",Databases

Efforts to eliminate spurious results have enjoyed some success by using the concepts of LCA or its variants, SLCA and MLCA. However, existing methods still could find many spurious results. The fundamental cause for the occurrence of spurious results is that the existing methods try to eliminate spurious results locally without global examination of all the query results and, accordingly, some spurious results are not consistently eliminated. In this paper, we propose a novel keyword search method that removes spurious results consistently by exploiting the new concept of structural consistency.",Databases

  Multidatabase System and Local Schemas Modifications Propagation",One of the challenging problems in the multidatabase systems is to find the most viable solution to the problem of interoperability of distributed heterogeneous autonomous local component databases. This has resulted in the creation of a global schema over set of these local component database schemas to provide a uniform representation of local schemas. The aim of this paper is to use object oriented approach to integrate schemas of distributed heterogeneous autonomous local component database schemas into a global schema. The resulting global schema provides a uniform interface and high level of location transparency for retrieval of data from the local component databases. A set of integration operators are defined to integrate local schemas based on the semantic relevance of their classes and to provide a model independent representation of virtual classes of the global schema. The schematic representation and heterogeneity is also taken into account in the integration process. Justifications about Object Oriented Modal are also discussed. Bottom up local schema modifications propagation in Global schema is also considered to maintain Global schema as local schemas are autonomous and evolve over time. An example illustrates the applicability of the integration operator defined.,Databases

In this EDM, feature selection is to be made for the generation of subset of candidate variables. As the feature selection influences the predictive accuracy of any performance model, it is essential to study elaborately the effectiveness of student performance model in connection with feature selection techniques. In this connection, the present study is devoted not only to investigate the most relevant subset features with minimum cardinality for achieving high predictive performance by adopting various filtered feature selection techniques in data mining but also to evaluate the goodness of subsets with different cardinalities and the quality of six filtered feature selection algorithms in terms of F-measure value and Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) value, generated by the NaiveBayes algorithm as base-line classifier method. The comparative study carried out by us on six filter feature section algorithms reveals the best method, as well as optimal dimensionality of the feature subset. Benchmarking of filter feature selection method is subsequently carried out by deploying different classifier models.

3377,The Hardness and Approximation Algorithms for L-Diversity,"The existing solutions to privacy preserving publication can be classified into the theoretical and heuristic categories. The former guarantees provably low information loss, whereas the latter incurs gigantic loss in the worst case, but is shown empirically to perform well on many real inputs. While numerous heuristic algorithms have been developed to satisfy advanced privacy principles such as l-diversity, t-closeness, etc., the theoretical category is currently limited to k-anonymity which is the earliest principle known to have severe vulnerability to privacy attacks. Motivated by this, we present the first theoretical study on l-diversity, a popular principle that is widely adopted in the literature. First, we show that optimal l-diverse generalization is NP-hard even when there are only 3 distinct sensitive values in the microdata. Then, an (l*d)-approximation algorithm is developed, where d is the dimensionality of the underlying dataset. This is the first known algorithm with a non-trivial bound on information loss.

Data mining is a main step in knowledge discovery process. Meanwhile frequent patterns play central role in data mining tasks such as clustering, classification, and association analysis. Identifying all frequent patterns is the most time consuming process due to a massive number of candidate patterns. For the past decade there have been an increasing number of efficient algorithms to mine the frequent patterns. However reducing the number of candidate patterns and comparisons for support counting are still two problems in this field which have made the frequent pattern mining one of the active research themes in data mining. A reasonable solution is identifying a small candidate pattern set from which can generate all frequent patterns.

We investigate the querying of objects described by a tree-structured ontology. Specifically, we consider the case of finding the top-k best pairs of objects that have been annotated with terms from such an ontology when the object descriptions are available only at runtime. We consider three distance measures. The first one defines the object distance as the minimum pairwise distance between the sets of terms describing them, and the second one defines the distance as the average pairwise term distance. The third and most useful distance measure, earth mover's distance, finds the best way of matching the terms and computes the distance corresponding to this best matching. We develop lower bounds that can be aggregated progressively and utilize them to speed up the search for top-k object pairs when the earth mover's distance is used. For the minimum pairwise distance, we devise an algorithm that runs in O(D + Tk log k) time, where D is the total information size and T is the total number of terms in the ontology. We also develop a novel best-first search strategy for the average pairwise distance that utilizes lower bounds generated in an ordered manner.

  for Storing Data into Flash Memory","Flash memory is widely used as the secondary storage in lightweight computing devices due to its outstanding advantages over magnetic disks. Flash memory has many access characteristics different from those of magnetic disks, and how to take advantage of them is becoming an important research issue. There are two existing approaches to storing data into flash memory: page-based and log-based. The former has good performance for read operations, but poor performance for write operations. In contrast, the latter has good performance for write operations when updates are light, but poor performance for read operations. In this paper, we propose a new method of storing data, called page-differential logging, for flash-based storage systems that solves the drawbacks of the two methods. The primary characteristics of our method are: (1) writing only the difference (which we define as the page-differential) between the original page in flash memory and the up-to-date page in memory; (2) computing and writing the page-differential only once at the time the page needs to be reflected into flash memory. The former contrasts with existing page-based methods that write the whole page including both changed and unchanged parts of data or from log-based ones that keep track of the history of all the changes in a page. Our method allows existing disk-based DBMSs to be reused as flash-based DBMSs just by modifying the flash memory driver, i.e., it is DBMS-independent.

With the explosive growth of information sources available on the World Wide Web, it has become increasingly difficult to identify the relevant pieces of information, since web pages are often cluttered with irrelevant content like advertisements, navigation-panels, copyright notices etc., surrounding the main content of the web page. Hence, it is useful to mine such data regions and data records in order to extract information from such web pages to provide value-added services. Currently available automatic techniques to mine data regions and data records from web pages are still unsatisfactory because of their poor performance. In this paper a novel method to identify and extract the flat and nested data records from the web pages automatically is proposed. It comprises of two steps : (1) Identification and Extraction of the data regions based on visual clues information. (2) Identification and extraction of flat and nested data records from the data region of a web page automatically. For step1, a novel and more effective method is proposed, which finds the data regions formed by all types of tags using visual clues. For step2, a more effective and efficient method namely, Visual Clue based Extraction of web Data (VCED), is proposed, which extracts each record from the data region and identifies it whether it is a flat or nested data record based on visual clue information the area covered by and the number of data items present in each record.

To this end, we use the chi-square measure. We propose two heuristics for retrieving the top-k substrings with the largest chi-square measure. We show that the algorithms outperform other competing algorithms in the runtime, while maintaining a high approximation ratio of more than 0.96.",Databases
3392,View Synthesis from Schema Mappings,"In data management, and in particular in data integration, data exchange, query optimization, and data privacy, the notion of view plays a central role. In several contexts, such as data integration, data mashups, and data warehousing, the need arises of designing views starting from a set of known correspondences between queries over different schemas. In this paper we deal with the issue of automating such a design process. We call this novel problem ""view synthesis from schema mappings"": given a set of schema mappings, each relating a query over a source schema to a query over a target schema, automatically synthesize for each source a view over the target schema in such a way that for each mapping, the query over the source is a rewriting of the query over the target wrt the synthesized views. We study view synthesis from schema mappings both in the relational setting, where queries and views are (unions of) conjunctive queries, and in the semistructured data setting, where queries and views are (two-way) regular path queries, as well as unions of conjunctions thereof. We provide techniques and complexity upper bounds for each of these cases.",Databases
3393,"Hierarchical Approach for Online Mining--Emphasis towards Software
  Metrics","Several multi-pass algorithms have been proposed for Association Rule Mining from static repositories. However, such algorithms are incapable of online processing of transaction streams. In this paper we introduce an efficient single-pass algorithm for mining association rules, given a hierarchical classification amongest items. Processing efficiency is achieved by utilizing two optimizations, hierarchy aware counting and transaction reduction, which become possible in the context of hierarchical classification. This paper considers the problem of integrating constraints that are Boolean expression over the presence or absence of items into the association discovery algorithm. This paper present three integrated algorithms for mining association rules with item constraints and discuss their tradeoffs. It is concluded that the variation of complexity depends on the measure of DIT (Depth of Inheritance Tree) and NOC (Number of Children) in the context of Hierarchical Classification.",Databases

3395,Adding HL7 version 3 data types to PostgreSQL,"The HL7 standard is widely used to exchange medical information electronically. As a part of the standard, HL7 defines scalar communication data types like physical quantity, point in time and concept descriptor but also complex types such as interval types, collection types and probabilistic types. Typical HL7 applications will store their communications in a database, resulting in a translation from HL7 concepts and types into database types. Since the data types were not designed to be implemented in a relational database server, this transition is cumbersome and fraught with programmer error. The purpose of this paper is two fold. First we analyze the HL7 version 3 data type definitions and define a number of conditions that must be met, for the data type to be suitable for implementation in a relational database. As a result of this analysis we describe a number of possible improvements in the HL7 specification. Second we describe an implementation in the PostgreSQL database server and show that the database server can effectively execute scientific calculations with units of measure, supports a large number of operations on time points and intervals, and can perform operations that are akin to a medical terminology server. Experiments on synthetic data show that the user defined types perform better than an implementation that uses only standard data types from the database server.",Databases

Here, reasons are investigated why SXSI is so fast. It is shown that tree automata can be used as a general framework for fine grained XML query optimization. We define the ""relevant nodes"" of a query as those nodes that a minimal automaton must touch in order to answer the query. This notion allows to skip many subtrees during execution, and, with the help of particular tree indexes, even allows to skip internal nodes of the tree. We efficiently approximate runs over relevant nodes by means of on-the-fly removal of alternation and non-determinism of (alternating) tree automata. We also introduce many implementation techniques which allows us to efficiently evaluate tree automata, even in the absence of special indexes. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the impact of the different optimization techniques.",Databases

However, commutativity has also a number of attracting properties, one of which is related to recovery and, to our knowledge, has not been exploited in the literature.

Most existing techniques, however, implicitly assume that the adversary knows little about the anonymization algorithm adopted by the data publisher. Consequently, they cannot guard against privacy attacks that exploit various characteristics of the anonymization mechanism. This paper provides a practical solution to the above problem. First, we propose an analytical model for evaluating disclosure risks, when an adversary knows everything in the anonymization process, except the sensitive values. Based on this model, we develop a privacy principle, transparent l-diversity, which ensures privacy protection against such powerful adversaries. We identify three algorithms that achieve transparent l-diversity, and verify their effectiveness and efficiency through extensive experiments with real data.",Databases

Anonymization of these social graphs is important to facilitate publishing these data sets for analysis by external entities. Prior work has concentrated mostly on node identity anonymization and structural anonymization. But with the growing interest in analyzing social networks as a weighted network, edge weight anonymization is also gaining importance. We present An\'onimos, a Linear Programming based technique for anonymization of edge weights that preserves linear properties of graphs. Such properties form the foundation of many important graph-theoretic algorithms such as shortest paths problem, k-nearest neighbors, minimum cost spanning tree, and maximizing information spread. As a proof of concept, we apply An\'onimos to the shortest paths problem and its extensions, prove the correctness, analyze complexity, and experimentally evaluate it using real social network data sets. Our experiments demonstrate that An\'onimos anonymizes the weights, improves k-anonymity of the weights, and also scrambles the relative ordering of the edges sorted by weights, thereby providing robust and effective anonymization of the sensitive edge-weights. Additionally, we demonstrate the composability of different models generated using An\'onimos, a property that allows a single anonymized graph to preserve multiple linear properties.",Databases

Due to the diverse nature of extraction operators (often implemented by independent groups), it is time consuming and error-prone to describe operator semantics formally or operationally to a provenance system.

This allows the effort to be proportional to the need, and to focus on the portions of the pipeline under the greatest suspicion. We present a generic debugger for running post-execution analysis of any IE pipeline consisting of arbitrary types of operators. We propose an effective provenance model for IE pipelines which captures a variety of operator types, ranging from those for which full or no specifications are available.

3411,An Optimized Weighted Association Rule Mining On Dynamic Content,"Association rule mining aims to explore large transaction databases for association rules. Classical Association Rule Mining (ARM) model assumes that all items have the same significance without taking their weight into account. It also ignores the difference between the transactions and importance of each and every itemsets. But, the Weighted Association Rule Mining (WARM) does not work on databases with only binary attributes. It makes use of the importance of each itemset and transaction. WARM requires each item to be given weight to reflect their importance to the user. The weights may correspond to special promotions on some products, or the profitability of different items. This research work first focused on a weight assignment based on a directed graph where nodes denote items and links represent association rules. A generalized version of HITS is applied to the graph to rank the items, where all nodes and links are allowed to have weights. This research then uses enhanced HITS algorithm by developing an online eigenvector calculation method that can compute the results of mutual reinforcement voting in case of frequent updates. For Example in Share Market Shares price may go down or up. So we need to carefully watch the market and our association rule mining has to produce the items that have undergone frequent changes. These are done by estimating the upper bound of perturbation and postponing of the updates whenever possible. Next we prove that enhanced algorithm is more efficient than the original HITS under the context of dynamic data.",Databases

In case of failures, recovery can also be performed with in-network decisions. In this paper we demonstrate how in-network cube hierarchies can be used to summarize sensor data, and how they can be exploited to improve the efficiency of spatial aggregate queries. We show that query plans over our cube summaries can be computed in polynomial time, and we present a PTIME algorithm that selects the minimum number of data requests that can compute the answer to a spatial query.

  Databases (Technical Report)","Frequent itemset mining in uncertain transaction databases semantically and computationally differs from traditional techniques applied on standard (certain) transaction databases. Uncertain transaction databases consist of sets of existentially uncertain items. The uncertainty of items in transactions makes traditional techniques inapplicable. In this paper, we tackle the problem of finding probabilistic frequent itemsets based on possible world semantics. In this context, an itemset X is called frequent if the probability that X occurs in at least minSup transactions is above a given threshold. We make the following contributions: We propose the first probabilistic FP-Growth algorithm (ProFP-Growth) and associated probabilistic FP-Tree (ProFP-Tree), which we use to mine all probabilistic frequent itemsets in uncertain transaction databases without candidate generation. In addition, we propose an efficient technique to compute the support probability distribution of an itemset in linear time using the concept of generating functions.

Enforcing a matching dependency on a database instance identifies the values of some attributes for two tuples, provided that the values of some other attributes are sufficiently similar. Assuming the existence of matching functions for making two attributes values equal, we formally introduce the process of cleaning an instance using matching dependencies, as a chase-like procedure. We show that matching functions naturally introduce a lattice structure on attribute domains, and a partial order of semantic domination between instances. Using the latter, we define the semantics of clean query answering in terms of certain/possible answers as the greatest lower bound/least upper bound of all possible answers obtained from the clean instances. We show that clean query answering is intractable in some cases. Then we study queries that behave monotonically wrt semantic domination order, and show that we can provide an under/over approximation for clean answers to monotone queries. Moreover, non-monotone positive queries can be relaxed into monotone queries.",Databases

The counting extensions can be seen as a generalization of graded modalities that count immediate successor nodes. While the combination of graded modalities, nominals, and inverse modalities yields undecidable logics over graphs, we show that these features can be combined in a decidable tree logic whose main features can be decided in exponential time.

Instead of returning all the answers, such queries return only the best answers, according to a given preference relation. Preference queries are a fast growing area of database research. Skyline queries constitute one of the most thoroughly studied classes of preference queries. A well known limitation of skyline queries is that skyline preference relations assign the same importance to all attributes. In this work, we study p-skyline queries that generalize skyline queries by allowing varying attribute importance in preference relations. We perform an in-depth study of the properties of p-skyline preference relations. In particular,we study the problems of containment and minimal extension. We apply the obtained results to the central problem of the paper: eliciting relative importance of attributes. Relative importance is implicit in the constructed p-skyline preference relation. The elicitation is based on user-selected sets of superior (positive) and inferior (negative) examples. We show that the computational complexity of elicitation depends on whether inferior examples are involved. If they are not, elicitation can be achieved in polynomial time. Otherwise, it is NP-complete. Our experiments show that the proposed elicitation algorithm has high accuracy and good scalability",Databases
3425,"The Conceptual Integration Modeling Framework: Abstracting from the
  Multidimensional Model","Data warehouses are overwhelmingly built through a bottom-up process, which starts with the identification of sources, continues with the extraction and transformation of data from these sources, and then loads the data into a set of data marts according to desired multidimensional relational schemas. End user business intelligence tools are added on top of the materialized multidimensional schemas to drive decision making in an organization. Unfortunately, this bottom-up approach is costly both in terms of the skilled users needed and the sheer size of the warehouses. This paper proposes a top-down framework in which data warehousing is driven by a conceptual model. The framework offers both design time and run time environments. At design time, a business user first uses the conceptual modeling language as a multidimensional object model to specify what business information is needed; then she maps the conceptual model to a pre-existing logical multidimensional representation. At run time, a system will transform the user conceptual model together with the mappings into views over the logical multidimensional representation. We focus on how the user can conceptually abstract from an existing data warehouse, and on how this conceptual model can be mapped to the logical multidimensional representation. We also give an indication of what query language is used over the conceptual model. Finally, we argue that our framework is a step along the way to allowing automatic generation of the data warehouse.",Databases

Our main goal is to establish a comprehensive framework of semantics for active integrity constraints, to find a parallel framework for revision programs, and to relate the two. By doing so, we demonstrate that the two formalisms proposed independently of each other and based on different intuitions when viewed within a broader semantic framework turn out to be notational variants of each other. That lends support to the adequacy of the semantics we develop for each of the formalisms as the foundation for a declarative approach to the problem of database update and repair. In the paper we also study computational properties of the semantics we consider and establish results concerned with the concept of the minimality of change and the invariance under the shifting transformation.",Databases

In real life situations, temporal databases are often appended or updated. Rescanning the whole database every time is highly expensive while existing incremental mining techniques can efficiently solve such a problem. In this paper, we propose an incremental algorithm for cyclic association rules maintenance. The carried out experiments of our proposal stress on its efficiency and performance.",Databases
3435,"Rule-based Generation of Diff Evolution Mappings between Ontology
  Versions","Ontologies such as taxonomies, product catalogs or web directories are heavily used and hence evolve frequently to meet new requirements or to better reflect the current instance data of a domain. To effectively manage the evolution of ontologies it is essential to identify the difference (Diff) between two ontology versions. We propose a novel approach to determine an expressive and invertible diff evolution mapping between given versions of an ontology. Our approach utilizes the result of a match operation to determine an evolution mapping consisting of a set of basic change operations (insert/update/delete). To semantically enrich the evolution mapping we adopt a rule-based approach to transform the basic change operations into a smaller set of more complex change operations, such as merge, split, or changes of entire subgraphs. The proposed algorithm is customizable in different ways to meet the requirements of diverse ontologies and application scenarios. We evaluate the proposed approach by determining and analyzing evolution mappings for real-world life science ontologies and web directories.",Databases
3436,"Preserving Privacy in Sequential Data Release against Background
  Knowledge Attacks","A large amount of transaction data containing associations between individuals and sensitive information flows everyday into data stores. Examples include web queries, credit card transactions, medical exam records, transit database records. The serial release of these data to partner institutions or data analysis centers is a common situation. In this paper we show that, in most domains, correlations among sensitive values associated to the same individuals in different releases can be easily mined, and used to violate users' privacy by adversaries observing multiple data releases. We provide a formal model for privacy attacks based on this sequential background knowledge, as well as on background knowledge on the probability distribution of sensitive values over different individuals. We show how sequential background knowledge can be actually obtained by an adversary, and used to identify with high confidence the sensitive values associated with an individual. A defense algorithm based on Jensen-Shannon divergence is proposed, and extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed technique with respect to other applicable solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that systematically investigates the role of sequential background knowledge in serial release of transaction data.",Databases
3437,Ontological Matchmaking in Recommender Systems,"The electronic marketplace offers great potential for the recommendation of supplies. In the so called recommender systems, it is crucial to apply matchmaking strategies that faithfully satisfy the predicates specified in the demand, and take into account as much as possible the user preferences. We focus on real-life ontology-driven matchmaking scenarios and identify a number of challenges, being inspired by such scenarios. A key challenge is that of presenting the results to the users in an understandable and clear-cut fashion in order to facilitate the analysis of the results. Indeed, such scenarios evoke the opportunity to rank and group the results according to specific criteria. A further challenge consists of presenting the results to the user in an asynchronous fashion, i.e. the 'push' mode, along with the 'pull' mode, in which the user explicitly issues a query, and displays the results. Moreover, an important issue to consider in real-life cases is the possibility of submitting a query to multiple providers, and collecting the various results. We have designed and implemented an ontology-based matchmaking system that suitably addresses the above challenges. We have conducted a comprehensive experimental study, in order to investigate the usability of the system, the performance and the effectiveness of the matchmaking strategies with real ontological datasets.",Databases

The underlying idea is to discard from the representation the skycuboids which can be computed again the most easily. To meet this reduction objective, we characterize a formal framework: the agree concept lattice. From this structure, we derive the skyline concept lattice which is one of its constrained instances. The strong points of our approach are: (i) it is attribute oriented; (ii) it provides a boundary for the number of lattice nodes; (iii) it facilitates the navigation within the Skycuboids.",Databases

By using Genetic Algorithm (GA) we can improve the scenario. The major advantage of using GA in the discovery of frequent itemsets is that they perform global search and its time complexity is less compared to other algorithms as the genetic algorithm is based on the greedy approach.

3441,"Individual Privacy vs Population Privacy: Learning to Attack
  Anonymization","Over the last decade there have been great strides made in developing techniques to compute functions privately. In particular, Differential Privacy gives strong promises about conclusions that can be drawn about an individual. In contrast, various syntactic methods for providing privacy (criteria such as kanonymity and l-diversity) have been criticized for still allowing private information of an individual to be inferred. In this report, we consider the ability of an attacker to use data meeting privacy definitions to build an accurate classifier. We demonstrate that even under Differential Privacy, such classifiers can be used to accurately infer ""private"" attributes in realistic data. We compare this to similar approaches for inferencebased attacks on other forms of anonymized data. We place these attacks on the same scale, and observe that the accuracy of inference of private attributes for Differentially Private data and l-diverse data can be quite similar.",Databases
3442,"Faster Query Answering in Probabilistic Databases using Read-Once
  Functions","A boolean expression is in read-once form if each of its variables appears exactly once. When the variables denote independent events in a probability space, the probability of the event denoted by the whole expression in read-once form can be computed in polynomial time (whereas the general problem for arbitrary expressions is #P-complete). Known approaches to checking read-once property seem to require putting these expressions in disjunctive normal form. In this paper, we tell a better story for a large subclass of boolean event expressions: those that are generated by conjunctive queries without self-joins and on tuple-independent probabilistic databases. We first show that given a tuple-independent representation and the provenance graph of an SPJ query plan without self-joins, we can, without using the DNF of a result event expression, efficiently compute its co-occurrence graph. From this, the read-once form can already, if it exists, be computed efficiently using existing techniques. Our second and key contribution is a complete, efficient, and simple to implement algorithm for computing the read-once forms (whenever they exist) directly, using a new concept, that of co-table graph, which can be significantly smaller than the co-occurrence graph.",Databases

3450,A fast divide-and-conquer algorithm for indexing human genome sequences,"Since the release of human genome sequences, one of the most important research issues is about indexing the genome sequences, and the suffix tree is most widely adopted for that purpose.

The recent disk-based algorithms also have limited performance improvement due to random disk accesses. Moreover, they do not fully utilize the recent CPUs with multiple cores. In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm based on 'divide-and-conquer' strategy for indexing the human genome sequences. Our algorithm almost eliminates random disk accesses by accessing the disk in the unit of contiguous chunks. In addition, our algorithm fully utilizes the multi-core CPUs by dividing the genome sequences into multiple partitions and then assigning each partition to a different core for parallel processing. Experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the previous fastest DIGEST algorithm by up to 3.5 times.",Databases

The approach is target-driven, i.e. we merge a source taxonomy into the target taxonomy and preserve the structure of the target ontology as much as possible.

The index allows to execute arbitrary tree algorithms with a slow-down that is comparable to the space improvement. More interestingly, certain algorithms execute much faster over the index (because no decompression occurs). E.g., for structural XPath count queries, evaluating over the index is faster than previous XPath implementations, often by two orders of magnitude. The index also allows to serialize XML results (including texts) faster than previous systems, by a factor of ca. 2-3. This is due to efficient copy handling of grammar repetitions, and because materialization is totally avoided.

We show that aggregate queries pose novel challenges rendering this approach inapplicable. Consequently, we propose a new approach, where we annotate with provenance information not just tuples but also the individual values within tuples, using provenance to describe the values computation. We realize this approach in a concrete construction, first for ""simple"" queries where the aggregation operator is the last one applied, and then for arbitrary (positive) relational algebra queries with aggregation; the latter queries are shown to be more challenging in this context. Finally, we use aggregation to encode queries with difference, and study the semantics obtained for such queries on provenance annotated databases.",Databases

  Uncertain Databases","In this paper, we propose a novel, effective and efficient probabilistic pruning criterion for probabilistic similarity queries on uncertain data. Our approach supports a general uncertainty model using continuous probabilistic density functions to describe the (possibly correlated) uncertain attributes of objects. In a nutshell, the problem to be solved is to compute the PDF of the random variable denoted by the probabilistic domination count: Given an uncertain database object B, an uncertain reference object R and a set D of uncertain database objects in a multi-dimensional space, the probabilistic domination count denotes the number of uncertain objects in D that are closer to R than B. This domination count can be used to answer a wide range of probabilistic similarity queries. Specifically, we propose a novel geometric pruning filter and introduce an iterative filter-refinement strategy for conservatively and progressively estimating the probabilistic domination count in an efficient way while keeping correctness according to the possible world semantics. In an experimental evaluation, we show that our proposed technique allows to acquire tight probability bounds for the probabilistic domination count quickly, even for large uncertain databases.",Databases

3462,Differentially Private Publication of Sparse Data,"The problem of privately releasing data is to provide a version of a dataset without revealing sensitive information about the individuals who contribute to the data. The model of differential privacy allows such private release while providing strong guarantees on the output. A basic mechanism achieves differential privacy by adding noise to the frequency counts in the contingency tables (or, a subset of the count data cube) derived from the dataset. However, when the dataset is sparse in its underlying space, as is the case for most multi-attribute relations, then the effect of adding noise is to vastly increase the size of the published data: it implicitly creates a huge number of dummy data points to mask the true data, making it almost impossible to work with.   We present techniques to overcome this roadblock and allow efficient private release of sparse data, while maintaining the guarantees of differential privacy. Our approach is to release a compact summary of the noisy data. Generating the noisy data and then summarizing it would still be very costly, so we show how to shortcut this step, and instead directly generate the summary from the input data, without materializing the vast intermediate noisy data. We instantiate this outline for a variety of sampling and filtering methods, and show how to use the resulting summary for approximate, private, query answering. Our experimental study shows that this is an effective, practical solution, with comparable and occasionally improved utility over the costly materialization approach.",Databases

3470,On the Scalability of Multidimensional Databases,"It is commonly accepted in the practice of on-line analytical processing of databases that the multidimensional database organization is less scalable than the relational one. It is easy to see that the size of the multidimensional organization may increase very quickly. For example, if we introduce one additional dimension, then the total number of possible cells will be at least doubled. However, this reasoning does not takethe fact into account that the multidimensional organization can be compressed. There are compression techniques, which can remove all or at least a part of the empty cells from the multidimensional organization, while maintaining a good retrieval performance. Relational databases often use B-tree indices to speed up the access to given rows of tables. It can be proven, under some reasonable assumptions, that the total size of the table and the B-tree index is bigger than a compressed multidimensional representation. This implies that the compressed array results in a smaller database and faster access at the same time. This paper compares several compression techniques and shows when we should and should not apply compressed arrays instead of relational tables.",Databases

3472,"Multidimensional or Relational? / How to Organize an On-line Analytical
  Processing Database","In the past few years, the number of OLAP applications increased quickly. These applications use two significantly different DB structures: multidimensional (MD) and table-based. One can show that the traditional model of relational databases cannot make difference between these two structures. Another model is necessary to make the differences visible. One of these is the speed of the system. It can be proven that the multidimensional DB organization results in shorter response times. And it is crucial, since a manager may become impatient, if he or she has to wait say more than 20 seconds for the next screen. On the other hand, we have to pay for the speed with a bigger DB size. Why does the size of MD databases grow so quickly? The reason is the sparsity of data: The MD matrix contains many empty cells. Efficient handling of sparse matrices is indispensable in an OLAP application. One way to handle sparsity is to take the structure closer to the table-based one. Thus the DB size decreases, while the application gets slower. Therefore, other methods are needed. This paper deals with the comparison of the two DB structures and the limits of their usage. The new results of the paper: (1) It gives a constructive proof that all relations can be represented in MD arrays. (2) It also shows when the MD array representation is quicker than the table-based one. (3) The MD representation results in smaller DB size under some conditions. One such sufficient condition is proved in the paper. (4) A variation of the single count header compression scheme is described with an algorithm, which creates the compressed array from the ordered table without materializing the uncompressed array.

In other words, the user of the OLAP application runs his or her queries one after the other. The output of the last query may be there (at least partly) in one of the previous results. Therefore caching also plays an important role in the operation of these systems. However, caching itself may not be enough to ensure acceptable performance. Size does matter: The more memory is available, the more we gain by loading and keeping information in there. Oftentimes, the cache size is fixed. This limits the performance of the multidimensional database, as well, unless we compress the data in order to move a greater proportion of them into the memory. Caching combined with proper compression methods promise further performance improvements. In this paper, we investigate how caching influences the speed of OLAP systems. Different physical representations (multidimensional and table) are evaluated. For the thorough comparison, models are proposed. We draw conclusions based on these models, and the conclusions are verified with empirical data.",Databases
3474,Difference-Huffman Coding of Multidimensional Databases,"A new compression method called difference-Huffman coding (DHC) is introduced in this paper. It is verified empirically that DHC results in a smaller multidimensional physical representation than those for other previously published techniques (single count header compression, logical position compression, base-offset compression and difference sequence compression). The article examines how caching influences the expected retrieval time of the multidimensional and table representations of relations. A model is proposed for this, which is then verified with empirical data. Conclusions are drawn, based on the model and the experiment, about when one physical representation outperforms another in terms of retrieval time. Over the tested range of available memory, the performance for the multidimensional representation was always much quicker than for the table representation.",Databases

  Monitoring","In this paper, we present the design of a scalable, distributed stream processing system for RFID tracking and monitoring. Since RFID data lacks containment and location information that is key to query processing, we propose to combine location and containment inference with stream query processing in a single architecture, with inference as an enabling mechanism for high-level query processing. We further consider challenges in instantiating such a system in large distributed settings and design techniques for distributed inference and query processing. Our experimental results, using both real-world data and large synthetic traces, demonstrate the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of our proposed techniques.",Databases

3478,Differentially Private Spatial Decompositions,"Differential privacy has recently emerged as the de facto standard for private data release. This makes it possible to provide strong theoretical guarantees on the privacy and utility of released data. While it is well-known how to release data based on counts and simple functions under this guarantee, it remains to provide general purpose techniques to release different kinds of data. In this paper, we focus on spatial data such as locations and more generally any data that can be indexed by a tree structure. Directly applying existing differential privacy methods to this type of data simply generates noise. Instead, we introduce a new class of ""private spatial decompositions"": these adapt standard spatial indexing methods such as quadtrees and kd-trees to provide a private description of the data distribution. Equipping such structures with differential privacy requires several steps to ensure that they provide meaningful privacy guarantees. Various primitives, such as choosing splitting points and describing the distribution of points within a region, must be done privately, and the guarantees of the different building blocks composed to provide an overall guarantee. Consequently, we expose the design space for private spatial decompositions, and analyze some key examples. Our experimental study demonstrates that it is possible to build such decompositions efficiently, and use them to answer a variety of queries privately with high accuracy.",Databases

  Attributes in Similarity-based Fuzzy Databases - Scalability Evaluation","In this work we are analyzing scalability of the heuristic algorithm we used in the past to discover knowledge from multi-valued symbolic attributes in fuzzy databases. The non-atomic descriptors, characterizing a single attribute of a database record, are commonly used in fuzzy databases to reflect uncertainty about the recorded observation. In this paper, we present implementation details and scalability tests of the algorithm, which we developed to precisely interpret such non-atomic values and to transfer (i.e. defuzzify) the fuzzy tuples to the forms acceptable for many regular (i.e. atomic values based) data mining algorithms. Important advantages of our approach are: (1) its linear scalability, and (2) its unique capability of incorporating background knowledge, implicitly stored in the fuzzy database models in the form of fuzzy similarity hierarchy, into the interpretation/defuzzification process.",Databases
3480,Determining Relevance of Accesses at Runtime (Extended Version),"Consider the situation where a query is to be answered using Web sources that restrict the accesses that can be made on backend relational data by requiring some attributes to be given as input of the service. The accesses provide lookups on the collection of attributes values that match the binding. They can differ in whether or not they require arguments to be generated from prior accesses. Prior work has focused on the question of whether a query can be answered using a set of data sources, and in developing static access plans (e.g., Datalog programs) that implement query answering. We are interested in dynamic aspects of the query answering problem: given partial information about the data, which accesses could provide relevant data for answering a given query? We consider immediate and long-term notions of ""relevant accesses"", and ascertain the complexity of query relevance, for both conjunctive queries and arbitrary positive queries. In the process, we relate dynamic relevance of an access to query containment under access limitations and characterize the complexity of this problem; we produce several complexity results about containment that are of interest by themselves.",Databases
3481,"Latent table discovery by semantic relationship extraction between
  unrelated sets of entity sets of structured data sources","Querying is one of the basic functionality expected from a database system. Query efficiency is adversely affected by increase in the number of participating tables. Also, querying based on syntax largely limits the gamut of queries a database system can process. Syntactic queries rely on the database table structure, which is a cause of concern for large organisations due to incompatibility between heterogeneous systems that store data distributed across geographic locations. Solution to these problems is answered to some extent by moving towards semantic technology by making data and the database meaningful. In doing so, relationship between sets of entity sets will not be limited only to syntactic constraints but would also permit semantic connections nonetheless such relationships may be tacit, intangible and invisible. The goal of this work is to extract such hidden relationships between unrelated sets of entity sets and store them in a tangible form. A few sample cases are provided to vindicate that the proposed work improves querying significantly.",Databases
3482,Optimizing XML querying using type-based document projection,"XML data projection (or pruning) is a natural optimization for main memory query engines: given a query Q over a document D, the subtrees of D that are not necessary to evaluate Q are pruned, thus producing a smaller document D'; the query Q is then executed on D', hence avoiding to allocate and process nodes that will never be reached by Q. In this article, we propose a new approach, based on types, that greatly improves current solutions. Besides providing comparable or greater precision and far lesser pruning overhead, our solution ---unlike current approaches--- takes into account backward axes, predicates, and can be applied to multiple queries rather than just to single ones. A side contribution is a new type system for XPath able to handle backward axes. The soundness of our approach is formally proved. Furthermore, we prove that the approach is also complete (i.e., yields the best possible type-driven pruning) for a relevant class of queries and Schemas. We further validate our approach using the XMark and XPathMark benchmarks and show that pruning not only improves the main memory query engine's performances (as expected) but also those of state of the art native XML databases.",Databases

In this paper, a complete preprocessing methodology having merging, data cleaning, user/session identification and data formatting and summarization activities to improve the quality of data by reducing the quantity of data has been proposed. To validate the efficiency of the proposed preprocessing methodology, several experiments are conducted and the results show that the proposed methodology reduces the size of Web access log files down to 73-82% of the initial size and offers richer logs that are structured for further stages of Web Usage Mining (WUM).

3485,Privacy Preserving Moving KNN Queries,"We present a novel approach that protects trajectory privacy of users who access location-based services through a moving k nearest neighbor (MkNN) query. An MkNN query continuously returns the k nearest data objects for a moving user (query point). Simply updating a user's imprecise location such as a region instead of the exact position to a location-based service provider (LSP) cannot ensure privacy of the user for an MkNN query: continuous disclosure of regions enables the LSP to follow a user's trajectory. We identify the problem of trajectory privacy that arises from the overlap of consecutive regions while requesting an MkNN query and provide the first solution to this problem. Our approach allows a user to specify the confidence level that represents a bound of how much more the user may need to travel than the actual kth nearest data object. By hiding a user's required confidence level and the required number of nearest data objects from an LSP, we develop a technique to prevent the LSP from tracking the user's trajectory for MkNN queries. We propose an efficient algorithm for the LSP to find k nearest data objects for a region with a user's specified confidence level, which is an essential component to evaluate an MkNN query in a privacy preserving manner; this algorithm is at least two times faster than the state-of-the-art algorithm. Extensive experimental studies validate the effectiveness of our trajectory privacy protection technique and the efficiency of our algorithm.",Databases

  Databases","In recent years, there has been a lot of interest in the field of keyword querying relational databases. A variety of systems such as DBXplorer [ACD02], Discover [HP02] and ObjectRank [BHP04] have been proposed. Another such system is BANKS, which enables data and schema browsing together with keyword-based search for relational databases. It models tuples as nodes in a graph, connected by links induced by foreign key and other relationships. The size of the database graph that BANKS uses is proportional to the sum of the number of nodes and edges in the graph. Systems such as SPIN, which search on Personal Information Networks and use BANKS as the backend, maintain a lot of information about the users' data. Since these systems run on the user workstation which have other demands of memory, such a heavy use of memory is unreasonable and if possible, should be avoided. In order to alleviate this problem, we introduce EMBANKS (acronym for External Memory BANKS), a framework for an optimized disk-based BANKS system. The complexity of this framework poses many questions, some of which we try to answer in this thesis. We demonstrate that the cluster representation proposed in EMBANKS enables in-memory processing of very large database graphs.

However, as Web services evolve in a dynamic environment which is the Internet many changes can occur and affect them. A Web service is affected when one or more of its associated information sources is affected by schema changes. Changes can alter the information sources contents but also their schemas which may render Web services partially or totally undefined.

Until recently, most works in this context focused on positive query languages. The provenance semirings is a particular approach that was proven effective for these languages, and it was shown that when propagating provenance with semirings, the expected equivalence axioms of the corresponding query languages are satisfied. There have been several attempts to extend the framework to account for relational algebra queries with difference. We show here that these suggestions fail to satisfy some expected equivalence axioms (that in particular hold for queries on ""standard"" set and bag databases). Interestingly, we show that this is not a pitfall of these particular attempts, but rather every such attempt is bound to fail in satisfying these axioms, for some semirings.

3496,Synthesizing Products for Online Catalogs,"A high-quality, comprehensive product catalog is essential to the success of Product Search engines and shopping sites such as Yahoo! Shopping, Google Product Search or Bing Shopping. But keeping catalogs up-to-date becomes a challenging task, calling for the need of automated techniques. In this paper, we introduce the problem of product synthesis, a key component of catalog creation and maintenance. Given a set of offers advertised by merchants, the goal is to identify new products and add them to the catalog together with their (structured) attributes. A fundamental challenge is the scale of the problem: a Product Search engine receives data from thousands of merchants and millions of products; the product taxonomy contains thousands of categories, where each category comes in a different schema; and merchants use representations for products that are different from the ones used in the catalog of the Product Search engine.   We propose a system that provides an end-to-end solution to the product synthesis problem, and includes components for extraction, and addresses issues involved in data extraction from offers, schema reconciliation, and data fusion. We developed a novel and scalable technique for schema matching which leverages knowledge about previously-known instance-level associations between offers and products; and it is trained using automatically created training sets (no manually-labeled data is needed). We present an experimental evaluation of our system using data from Bing Shopping for more than 800K offers, a thousand merchants, and 400 categories.

While this is straightforward in principle, performance is an issue. We show how ARIES style recovery optimizations can work for logical recovery where page information is not captured on the log.

In particular, a Ranking Principle for Distributed Multimedia-Documents (RPDM) is described together with an algorithm that satisfies this principle. Finally, the RPDM is shown to be a generalization of the Probability Ranking principle (PRP) which guarantees optimal retrieval effectiveness in the case of text document retrieval. The PRP justifies theoretically the relevance ranking adopted by modern search engines. In contrast to the classical PRP, the new RPDM takes into account transmission and inspection time, and most importantly, aspectual recall rather than simple recall.",Digital Libraries
3866,A usage based analysis of CoRR,"Based on an empirical analysis of author usage of CoRR, and of its predecessor in the Los Alamos eprint archives, it is shown that CoRR has not yet been able to match the early growth of the Los Alamos physics archives. Some of the reasons are implicit in Halpern's paper, and we explore them further here. In particular we refer to the need to promote CoRR more effectively for its intended community - computer scientists in universities, industrial research labs and in government. We take up some points of detail on this new world of open archiving concerning central versus distributed self-archiving, publication, the restructuring of the journal publishers' niche, peer review and copyright.",Digital Libraries

We present a framework that separates digital object experience, or rendering, from digital object storage and manipulation, so the rendering can be tailored to particular communities of users. Our framework also accommodates extensible digital object behaviors and interoperability. The two key components of our approach are 1) exposing structural metadata associated with digital objects -- metadata about the labeled access points within a digital object and 2) information intermediaries called context brokers that match structural characteristics of digital objects with mechanisms that produce behaviors. These context brokers allow for localized rendering of digital information stored externally.",Digital Libraries

Longer term, a project should expect some archive to preserve the data. We observe that pub-lished scientific data needs to be available forever ? this gives rise to the data pyramid of versions and to data inflation where the derived data volumes explode.

Prior proposals fail because they confound saved data with irrelevant details of today's information technology--details that are difficult to define, extract, and save completely and accurately.   We use a virtual machine to represent and eventually to render any data whatsoever. We focus on a case of intermediate difficulty--an executable procedure--and identify a variant for every other data type. This solution might be more elaborate than needed to render some text, image, audio, or video data. Simple data can be preserved as representations using well-known standards. We sketch practical methods for files ranging from simple structures to those containing computer programs, treating simple cases here and deferring complex cases for future work.

3886,"aDORe: a modular, standards-based Digital Object Repository","This paper describes the aDORe repository architecture, designed and implemented for ingesting, storing, and accessing a vast collection of Digital Objects at the Research Library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory. The aDORe architecture is highly modular and standards-based. In the architecture, the MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration Language is used as the XML-based format to represent Digital Objects that can consist of multiple datastreams as Open Archival Information System Archival Information Packages (OAIS AIPs).Through an ingestion process, these OAIS AIPs are stored in a multitude of autonomous repositories. A Repository Index keeps track of the creation and location of all the autonomous repositories, whereas an Identifier Locator registers in which autonomous repository a given Digital Object or OAIS AIP resides. A front-end to the complete environment, the OAI-PMH Federator, is introduced for requesting OAIS Dissemination Information Packages (OAIS DIPs). These OAIS DIPs can be the stored OAIS AIPs themselves, or transformations thereof. This front-end allows OAI-PMH harvesters to recurrently and selectively collect batches of OAIS DIPs from aDORe, and hence to create multiple, parallel services using the collected objects. Another front-end, the OpenURL Resolver, is introduced for requesting OAIS Result Sets. An OAIS Result Set is a dissemination of an individual Digital Object or of its constituent datastreams. Both front-ends make use of an MPEG-21 Digital Item Processing Engine to apply services to OAIS AIPs, Digital Objects, or constituent datastreams that were specified in a dissemination request.",Digital Libraries

In this paper we examine the state of the DL domain after a decade of activity by applying social network analysis to the co-authorship network of the past ACM, IEEE, and joint ACM/IEEE digital library conferences. We base our analysis on a common binary undirectional network model to represent the co-authorship network, and from it we extract several established network measures. We also introduce a weighted directional network model to represent the co-authorship network, for which we define $AuthorRank$ as an indicator of the impact of an individual author in the network. The results are validated against conference program committee members in the same period. The results show clear advantages of PageRank and AuthorRank over degree, closeness and betweenness centrality metrics. We also investigate the amount and nature of international participation in Joint Conference on Digital Libraries (JCDL).",Digital Libraries

We believe the results represent a unique aspect of general journal impact that is not captured by the ISI IF. These results furthermore raise questions regarding the validity of the ISI IF as the sole assessment of journal impact, and suggest the possibility of devising impact metrics based on usage information in general.",Digital Libraries
3889,"File-based storage of Digital Objects and constituent datastreams:
  XMLtapes and Internet Archive ARC files","This paper introduces the write-once/read-many XMLtape/ARC storage approach for Digital Objects and their constituent datastreams. The approach combines two interconnected file-based storage mechanisms that are made accessible in a protocol-based manner. First, XML-based representations of multiple Digital Objects are concatenated into a single file named an XMLtape. An XMLtape is a valid XML file; its format definition is independent of the choice of the XML-based complex object format by which Digital Objects are represented. The creation of indexes for both the identifier and the creation datetime of the XML-based representation of the Digital Objects facilitates OAI-PMH-based access to Digital Objects stored in an XMLtape. Second, ARC files, as introduced by the Internet Archive, are used to contain the constituent datastreams of the Digital Objects in a concatenated manner. An index for the identifier of the datastream facilitates OpenURL-based access to an ARC file. The interconnection between XMLtapes and ARC files is provided by conveying the identifiers of ARC files associated with an XMLtape as administrative information in the XMLtape, and by including OpenURL references to constituent datastreams of a Digital Object in the XML-based representation of that Digital Object.",Digital Libraries

Systems claiming conformance to these standards are entering production use. Work is underway to certify that systems conform to requirements derived from OAIS.   We complement these requirements derived top-down by presenting an alternate, bottom-up view of the field. The fundamental goal of these systems is to ensure that the information they contain remains accessible for the long term. We develop a parallel set of requirements based on observations of how existing systems handle this task, and on an analysis of the threats to achieving the goal. On this basis we suggest disclosures that systems should provide as to how they satisfy their goals.",Digital Libraries

The MPEG-21 Digital Item Declaration (MPEG-21 DID) is another approach that can be used for the representation of digital assets in XML.

This paper will focus on the definition of common and standardized access interfaces that could be deployed across such diverse digital respository and archival systems. The proposed interfaces are based on the two formal specifications that have recently emerged from the Digital Library community: The Open Archive Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) and the NISO OpenURL Framework for Context-Sensitive Services (OpenURL Standard). As will be described, the former allows for the retrieval of batches of XML-based representations of digital assets, while the latter facilitates the retrieval of disseminations of a specific digital asset or of one or more of its constituents. The core properties of the proposed interfaces are explained in terms of the Reference Model for an Open Archival Information System (OAIS).",Digital Libraries

We extracted 4387 unique URLs referenced in 453 articles published from July 1995 to August 2004. The availability was checked three times a week for 25 weeks from September 2004 to February 2005. We found that approximately 28% of those URLs failed to resolve initially, and 30% failed to resolve at the last check. A majority of the unresolved URLs were due to 404 (page not found) and 500 (internal server error) errors. The content pointed to by the URLs was relatively stable; only 16% of the content registered more than a 1 KB change during the testing period. We explore possible factors which may cause a URL to fail by examining its age, path depth, top-level domain and file extension. Based on the data collected, we found the half-life of a URL referenced in a D-Lib Magazine article is approximately 10 years. We also found that URLs were more likely to be unavailable if they pointed to resources in the .net, .edu or country-specific top-level domain, used non-standard ports (i.e., not port 80), or pointed to resources with uncommon or deprecated extensions (e.g., .shtml, .ps, .txt).",Digital Libraries
3899,Dynamic Web File Format Transformations with Grace,"Web accessible content stored in obscure, unpopular or obsolete formats represents a significant problem for digital preservation. The file formats that encode web content represent the implicit and explicit choices of web site maintainers at a particular point in time. Older file formats that have fallen out of favor are obviously a problem, but so are new file formats that have not yet been fully supported by browsers. Often browsers use plug-in software for displaying old and new formats, but plug-ins can be difficult to find, install and replicate across all environments that one may use. We introduce Grace, an http proxy server that transparently converts browser-incompatible and obsolete web content into web content that a browser is able to display without the use of plug-ins. Grace is configurable on a per user basis and can be expanded to provide an array of conversion services. We illustrate how the Grace prototype transforms several image formats (XBM, PNG with various alpha channels, and JPEG 2000) so they are viewable in Internet Explorer.",Digital Libraries

3905,An Architecture for the Aggregation and Analysis of Scholarly Usage Data,"Although recording of usage data is common in scholarly information services, its exploitation for the creation of value-added services remains limited due to concerns regarding, among others, user privacy, data validity, and the lack of accepted standards for the representation, sharing and aggregation of usage data. This paper presents a technical, standards-based architecture for sharing usage information, which we have designed and implemented. In this architecture, OpenURL-compliant linking servers aggregate usage information of a specific user community as it navigates the distributed information environment that it has access to. This usage information is made OAI-PMH harvestable so that usage information exposed by many linking servers can be aggregated to facilitate the creation of value-added services with a reach beyond that of a single community or a single information service.

We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA).

How can we measure the prestige of a journal or of a conference? The evaluation of the scientific work of a scientist and the estimation of the quality of a journal or conference has long attracted significant interest, due to the benefits from obtaining an unbiased and fair criterion. Although it appears to be simple, defining a quality metric is not an easy task. To overcome the disadvantages of the present metrics used for ranking scientists and journals, J.E. Hirsch proposed a pioneering metric, the now famous h-index. In this article, we demonstrate several inefficiencies of this index and develop a pair of generalizations and effective variants of it to deal with scientist ranking and with publication forum ranking. The new citation indices are able to disclose trendsetters in scientific research, as well as researchers that constantly shape their field with their influential work, no matter how old they are.

The growing share and importance of freely accessible research output demands new approaches/metrics for measuring and for evaluating of these new types of scientific publications. In this paper we propose a simple quantitative method which establishes indicators by measuring the access/download pattern of OA documents and other web entities of a single web server. The experimental indicators (search engine, backlink and direct access indicator) are constructed based on standard local web usage data. This new type of web-based indicator is developed to model the specific demand for better study/evaluation of the accessibility, visibility and interlinking of open accessible documents. We conclude that e-science will need new stable e-indicators.",Digital Libraries
3912,"Usage Impact Factor: the effects of sample characteristics on
  usage-based impact metrics","There exist ample demonstrations that indicators of scholarly impact analogous to the citation-based ISI Impact Factor can be derived from usage data. However, contrary to the ISI IF which is based on citation data generated by the global community of scholarly authors, so far usage can only be practically recorded at a local level leading to community-specific assessments of scholarly impact that are difficult to generalize to the global scholarly community. We define a journal Usage Impact Factor which mimics the definition of the Thomson Scientific's ISI Impact Factor. Usage Impact Factor rankings are calculated on the basis of a large-scale usage data set recorded for the California State University system from 2003 to 2005. The resulting journal rankings are then compared to Thomson Scientific's ISI Impact Factor which is used as a baseline indicator of general impact. Our results indicate that impact as derived from California State University usage reflects the particular scientific and demographic characteristics of its communities.",Digital Libraries
3913,Protocols for Scholarly Communication,"CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, has operated an institutional preprint repository for more than 10 years. The repository contains over 850,000 records of which more than 450,000 are full-text OA preprints, mostly in the field of particle physics, and it is integrated with the library's holdings of books, conference proceedings, journals and other grey literature. In order to encourage effective propagation and open access to scholarly material, CERN is implementing a range of innovative library services into its document repository: automatic keywording, reference extraction, collaborative management tools and bibliometric tools. Some of these services, such as user reviewing and automatic metadata extraction, could make up an interesting testbed for future publishing solutions and certainly provide an exciting environment for e-science possibilities. The future protocol for scientific communication should naturally guide authors towards OA publication and CERN wants to help reach a full open access publishing environment for the particle physics community and the related sciences in the next few years.",Digital Libraries
3914,"Intra-site Level Cultural Heritage Documentation: Combination of Survey,
  Modeling and Imagery Data in a Web Information System","Cultural heritage documentation induces the use of computerized techniques to manage and preserve the information produced. Geographical information systems have proved their potentialities in this scope, but they are not always adapted for the management of features at the scale of a particular archaeological site. Moreover, computer applications in archaeology are often technology driven and software constrained. Thus, we propose a tool that tries to avoid these difficulties. We are developing an information system that works over the Internet and that is joined with a web site. Aims are to assist the work of archaeological sites managers and to be a documentation tool about these sites, dedicated to everyone. We devote therefore our system both to the professionals who are in charge of the site, and to the general public who visits it or who wants to have information on it. The system permits to do exploratory analyses of the data, especially at spatial and temporal levels. We propose to record metadata about the archaeological features in XML and to access these features through interactive 2D and 3D representations, and through queries systems (keywords and images). The 2D images, photos, or vectors are generated in SVG, while 3D models are generated in X3D. Archaeological features are also automatically integrated in a MySQL database. The web site is an exchange platform with the information system and is written in PHP. Our first application case is the medieval castle of Vianden, Luxembourg.",Digital Libraries

This robustness, and the ease with which h-indices can be verified, support the use of a Hirsch-type index over alternatives such as the journal impact factor. These merits of the h-index apply to both individuals and to journals.",Digital Libraries

  differential and media effects","In a study of articles published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Gunther Eysenbach discovered a significant citation advantage for those articles made freely-available upon publication (Eysenbach 2006). While the author attempted to control for confounding factors that may have explained the citation differential, the study was unable to control for characteristics of the article that may have led some authors to pay the additional page charges ($1,000) for immediate OA status. OA articles published in PNAS were more than twice as likely to be featured on the front cover of the journal (3.3% vs. 1.4%), nearly twice as likely to be picked up by the media (15% vs. 8%) and when cited reached, on average, nearly twice as many news outlets as subscription-based articles (4.2 vs. 2.6). The citation advantage of Open Access articles in PNAS may likely be explained by a quality differential and the amplification of media effects.",Digital Libraries
3917,Exploring the academic invisible web,"Purpose: To provide a critical review of Bergman's 2001 study on the Deep Web. In addition, we bring a new concept into the discussion, the Academic Invisible Web (AIW). We define the Academic Invisible Web as consisting of all databases and collections relevant to academia but not searchable by the general-purpose internet search engines. Indexing this part of the Invisible Web is central to scientific search engines. We provide an overview of approaches followed thus far. Design/methodology/approach: Discussion of measures and calculations, estimation based on informetric laws. Literature review on approaches for uncovering information from the Invisible Web. Findings: Bergman's size estimate of the Invisible Web is highly questionable. We demonstrate some major errors in the conceptual design of the Bergman paper. A new (raw) size estimate is given. Research limitations/implications: The precision of our estimate is limited due to a small sample size and lack of reliable data. Practical implications: We can show that no single library alone will be able to index the Academic Invisible Web. We suggest collaboration to accomplish this task. Originality/value: Provides library managers and those interested in developing academic search engines with data on the size and attributes of the Academic Invisible Web.",Digital Libraries
3918,A Comparison of On-Line Computer Science Citation Databases,"This paper examines the difference and similarities between the two on-line computer science citation databases DBLP and CiteSeer. The database entries in DBLP are inserted manually while the CiteSeer entries are obtained autonomously via a crawl of the Web and automatic processing of user submissions. CiteSeer's autonomous citation database can be considered a form of self-selected on-line survey. It is important to understand the limitations of such databases, particularly when citation information is used to assess the performance of authors, institutions and funding bodies.   We show that the CiteSeer database contains considerably fewer single author papers. This bias can be modeled by an exponential process with intuitive explanation. The model permits us to predict that the DBLP database covers approximately 24% of the entire literature of Computer Science. CiteSeer is also biased against low-cited papers.   Despite their difference, both databases exhibit similar and significantly different citation distributions compared with previous analysis of the Physics community. In both databases, we also observe that the number of authors per paper has been increasing over time.",Digital Libraries
3919,"Open Access Publishing in Particle Physics: A Brief Introduction for the
  non-Expert","Open Access to particle physics literature does not sound particularly new or exciting, since particle physicists have been reading preprints for decades, and arXiv.org for 15 years. However new movements in Europe are attempting to make the peer-reviewed literature of the field fully Open Access. This is not a new movement, nor is it restricted to this field. However, given the field's history of preprints and eprints, it is well suited to a change to a fully Open Access publishing model. Data shows that 90% of HEP published literature is freely available online, meaning that HEP libraries have little need for expensive journal subscriptions. As libraries begin to cancel journal subscriptions, the peer review process will lose its primary source of funding. Open Access publishing models can potentially address this issue. European physicists and funding agencies are proposing a consortium, SCOAP3, that might solve many of the objections to traditional Open Access publishing models in Particle Physics. These proposed changes should be viewed as a starting point for a serious look at the field's publication model, and are at least worthy of attention, if not adoption.",Digital Libraries

Empirical observations show that freely formulated user terms and terms from controlled vocabularies are often not the same or match just by coincidence. Therefore, a value-added service will be developed which rephrases the natural language searcher terms into suggestions from the controlled vocabulary, the Search Term Recommender (STR). Two methods, which are derived from scientometrics and network analysis, will be implemented with the objective to re-rank result sets by the following structural properties: the ranking of the results by core journals (so-called Bradfordizing) and ranking by centrality of authors in co-authorship networks.",Digital Libraries

3926,The aDORe Federation Architecture,"The need to federate repositories emerges in two distinctive scenarios. In one scenario, scalability-related problems in the operation of a repository reach a point beyond which continued service requires parallelization and hence federation of the repository infrastructure. In the other scenario, multiple distributed repositories manage collections of interest to certain communities or applications, and federation is an approach to present a unified perspective across these repositories. The high-level, 3-Tier aDORe federation architecture can be used as a guideline to federate repositories in both cases. This paper describes the architecture, consisting of core interfaces for federated repositories in Tier-1, two shared infrastructure components in Tier-2, and a single-point of access to the federation in Tier-3. The paper also illustrates two large-scale deployments of the aDORe federation architecture: the aDORe Archive repository (over 100,000,000 digital objects) at the Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Ghent University Image Repository federation (multiple terabytes of image files).",Digital Libraries

  Landscape and Charting the Future Course","Access to previous results is of paramount importance in the scientific process. Recent progress in information management focuses on building e-infrastructures for the optimization of the research workflow, through both policy-driven and user-pulled dynamics. For decades, High-Energy Physics (HEP) has pioneered innovative solutions in the field of information management and dissemination. In light of a transforming information environment, it is important to assess the current usage of information resources by researchers and HEP provides a unique test-bed for this assessment. A survey of about 10% of practitioners in the field reveals usage trends and information needs. Community-based services, such as the pioneering arXiv and SPIRES systems, largely answer the need of the scientists, with a limited but increasing fraction of younger users relying on Google. Commercial services offered by publishers or database vendors are essentially unused in the field. The survey offers an insight into the most important features that users require to optimize their research workflow. These results inform the future evolution of information management in HEP and, as these researchers are traditionally ``early adopters'' of innovation in scholarly communication, can inspire developments of disciplinary repositories serving other communities.",Digital Libraries

Due to the heterogeneity of these systems, mapping between vocabularies becomes crucial for retrieving relevant information. However, mapping thesauri is a laborious task, and thus big efforts are being made to automate the mapping process. This paper examines two mapping approaches involving the agricultural thesaurus AGROVOC, one machine-created and one human created. We are addressing the basic question ""What are the pros and cons of human and automatic mapping and how can they complement each other?"" By pointing out the difficulties in specific cases or groups of cases and grouping the sample into simple and difficult types of mappings, we show the limitations of current automatic methods and come up with some basic recommendations on what approach to use when.",Digital Libraries

For example, each year US News & World Report publishes a list of (among others) top 50 graduate business schools. Does their expert ranking correlate with the search engine ranking of the URLs of those business schools? To answer this question we conducted 9 experiments using 8 expert rankings on a range of academic, athletic, financial and popular culture topics. We compared the expert rankings with the rankings in Google, Live Search (formerly MSN) and Yahoo (with list lengths of 10, 25, and 50). In 57 search engine vs. expert comparisons, only 1 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. In 42 inter-search engine comparisons, only 2 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant.

Bradfordizing is used for generating core document sets for subject-specific questions and to reorder result sets from distributed searches. The method will be applied and tested in a controlled scenario of scientific literature databases from social and political sciences, economics, psychology and medical science (SOLIS, SoLit, USB Koeln Opac, CSA Sociological Abstracts, World Affairs Online, Psyndex and Medline) and 164 standardized topics. An evaluation of the method and its effects is carried out in two laboratory-based information retrieval experiments (CLEF and KoMoHe) using a controlled document corpus and human relevance assessments. The results show that Bradfordizing is a very robust method for re-ranking the main document types (journal articles and monographs) in today's digital libraries (DL). The IR tests show that relevance distributions after re-ranking improve at a significant level if articles in the core are compared with articles in the succeeding zones. The items in the core are significantly more often assessed as relevant, than items in zone 2 (z2) or zone 3 (z3).

The field of High- Energy Physics (HEP) has explored alternative communication strategies for decades, initially via the mass mailing of paper copies of preliminary manuscripts, then via the inception of the first online repositories and digital libraries.   This field is uniquely placed to answer recurrent questions raised by the current trends in scholarly communication: is there an advantage for scientists to make their work available through repositories, often in preliminary form? Is there an advantage to publishing in Open Access journals? Do scientists still read journals or do they use digital repositories?   The analysis of citation data demonstrates that free and immediate online dissemination of preprints creates an immense citation advantage in HEP, whereas publication in Open Access journals presents no discernible advantage. In addition, the analysis of clickstreams in the leading digital library of the field shows that HEP scientists seldom read journals, preferring preprints instead.",Digital Libraries

  supporting knowledge works in organizations","Designing and implementing comprehensive IT-based support environments for KM in organizations is fraught with many problems. Solving them requires intimate knowledge about the information usage in knowledge works and the scopes of technology intervention. In this paper, the Task-oriented Organizational Knowledge Management or TOKM, a design theory for building integrated IT platforms for supporting organizational KM, is proposed. TOKM brings together two apparently mutually exclusive practices of building KM systems, the task-based approach and the generic or universalistic approach. In developing the design, the information requirements of knowledge workers in light of an information usage model of knowledge works is studied. Then the model is extended to study possibilities of more advanced IT support and formulate them in form of a set of meta-requirements. Following the IS design theory paradigm, a set of artifacts are hypothesized to meet the requirements. Finally, a design method, as a possible approach of building an IT-based integrated platform, the Knowledge Work Support Platform (KWSP) to realize the artifacts in order to meet the requirements, is outlined. The KWSP is a powerful platform for building and maintaining a number of task-type specific Knowledge Work Support Systems (KWSS) on a common sharable platform. Each KWSS, for the task-type supported by it, can be easily designed to provide extensive and sophisticated support to individual as well as group of knowledge workers in performing their respective knowledge work instances",Digital Libraries

'Technomimetics' is proposed as a new method of knowledge management in science and technology: it shall help find and organise information in an era of over-information. Such ways of presenting and managing research results would be accessible by people with different kinds of backgrounds and levels of education, and allow for full use of the ever- increasing number of scientific and technical publications. This approach would dramatically change and revolutionize the way we are doing science, and contribute to overcoming the three gaps between the world of ideas, inventors, innovators and investors as introduced by Gebeshuber, Gruber and Drack in 2009 for accelerated scientific and technological breakthroughs to improve the human condition. Inspiration for the development of above methods was the fact that - generally - tribologists and biologists do not see many overlaps of their professions. However, both deal with materials, structures and processes. Tribology is omnipresent in biology and many biological systems have impressive tribological properties. Tribologists can therefore get valuable input and inspiration from living systems. The aim of biomimetics is knowledge transfer from biology to technology and successful biomimetics in tribology needs collaboration between biologists and tribologists. Literature search shows that the number of papers regarding biotribology is steadily increasing.

  Strings in PubMed Abstracts","Automatically extracting organization names from the affiliation sentences of articles related to biomedicine is of great interest to the pharmaceutical marketing industry, health care funding agencies and public health officials. It will also be useful for other scientists in normalizing author names, automatically creating citations, indexing articles and identifying potential resources or collaborators. Today there are more than 18 million articles related to biomedical research indexed in PubMed, and information derived from them could be used effectively to save the great amount of time and resources spent by government agencies in understanding the scientific landscape, including key opinion leaders and centers of excellence. Our process for extracting organization names involves multi-layered rule matching with multiple dictionaries.

For SNA of a particular disease area, we need to identify the key research groups in that area by mining the affiliation information from PubMed. This not only involves recognizing the organization names in the affiliation string, but also resolving ambiguities to identify the article with a unique organization. We present here a process of normalization that involves clustering based on local sequence alignment metrics and local learning based on finding connected components. We demonstrate the application of the method by analyzing organizations involved in angiogenensis treatment, and demonstrating the utility of the results for researchers in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries or national funding agencies.",Digital Libraries
3953,The Citation Field of Evolutionary Economics,"Evolutionary economics has developed into an academic field of its own, institutionalized around, amongst others, the Journal of Evolutionary Economics (JEE). This paper analyzes the way and extent to which evolutionary economics has become an interdisciplinary journal, as its aim was: a journal that is indispensable in the exchange of expert knowledge on topics and using approaches that relate naturally with it. Analyzing citation data for the relevant academic field for the Journal of Evolutionary Economics, we use insights from scientometrics and social network analysis to find that, indeed, the JEE is a central player in this interdisciplinary field aiming mostly at understanding technological and regional dynamics. It does not, however, link firmly with the natural sciences (including biology) nor to management sciences, entrepreneurship, and organization studies. Another journal that could be perceived to have evolutionary acumen, the Journal of Economic Issues, does relate to heterodox economics journals and is relatively more involved in discussing issues of firm and industry organization. The JEE seems most keen to develop theoretical insights.",Digital Libraries

The Button allows individual users to request and authors to provide a single eprint via semi-automated email. The purpose of the Button is to tide over research usage needs during any publisher embargo on Open Access and, more importantly, to make it possible for institutions to adopt the ""Immediate-Deposit/Optional-Access"" Mandate, without exceptions or opt-outs, instead of a mandate that allows delayed deposit or deposit waivers, depending on publisher permissions or embargoes (or no mandate at all). This is only ""Almost-Open Access,"" but in facilitating exception-free immediate-deposit mandates it will accelerate the advent of universal Open Access.",Digital Libraries

3956,Making Web Annotations Persistent over Time,"As Digital Libraries (DL) become more aligned with the web architecture, their functional components need to be fundamentally rethought in terms of URIs and HTTP. Annotation, a core scholarly activity enabled by many DL solutions, exhibits a clearly unacceptable characteristic when existing models are applied to the web: due to the representations of web resources changing over time, an annotation made about a web resource today may no longer be relevant to the representation that is served from that same resource tomorrow. We assume the existence of archived versions of resources, and combine the temporal features of the emerging Open Annotation data model with the capability offered by the Memento framework that allows seamless navigation from the URI of a resource to archived versions of that resource, and arrive at a solution that provides guarantees regarding the persistence of web annotations over time. More specifically, we provide theoretical solutions and proof-of-concept experimental evaluations for two problems: reconstructing an existing annotation so that the correct archived version is displayed for all resources involved in the annotation, and retrieving all annotations that involve a given archived version of a web resource.",Digital Libraries

  repositories, research repositories, national repository systems and
  institutional repositories in serving scholarly communication","After two decades of repository development, some conclusions may be drawn as to which type of repository and what kind of service best supports digital scholarly communication, and thus the production of new knowledge. Four types of publication repository may be distinguished, namely the subject-based repository, research repository, national repository system and institutional repository. Two important shifts in the role of repositories may be noted. With regard to content, a well-defined and high quality corpus is essential. This implies that repository services are likely to be most successful when constructed with the user and reader uppermost in mind. With regard to service, high value to specific scholarly communities is essential. This implies that repositories are likely to be most useful to scholars when they offer dedicated services supporting the production of new knowledge. Along these lines, challenges and barriers to repository development may be identified in three key dimensions: a) identification and deposit of content; b) access and use of services; and c) preservation of content and sustainability of service. An indicative comparison of challenges and barriers in some major world regions such as Europe, North America and East Asia plus Australia is offered in conclusion.",Digital Libraries
3958,Citing for High Impact,"The question of citation behavior has always intrigued scientists from various disciplines. While general citation patterns have been widely studied in the literature we develop the notion of citation projection graphs by investigating the citations among the publications that a given paper cites. We investigate how patterns of citations vary between various scientific disciplines and how such patterns reflect the scientific impact of the paper. We find that idiosyncratic citation patterns are characteristic for low impact papers; while narrow, discipline-focused citation patterns are common for medium impact papers. Our results show that crossing-community, or bridging citation patters are high risk and high reward since such patterns are characteristic for both low and high impact papers. Last, we observe that recently citation networks are trending toward more bridging and interdisciplinary forms.",Digital Libraries
3959,Analysis of Graphs for Digital Preservation Suitability,"We investigate the use of autonomically created small-world graphs as a framework for the long term storage of digital objects on the Web in a potentially hostile environment. We attack the classic Erdos - Renyi random, Barab'asi and Albert power law, Watts - Strogatz small world and our Unsupervised Small-World (USW) graphs using different attacker strategies and report their respective robustness. Using different attacker profiles, we construct a game where the attacker is allowed to use a strategy of his choice to remove a percentage of each graph's elements. The graph is then allowed to repair some portion of its self. We report on the number of alternating attack and repair turns until either the graph is disconnected, or the game exceeds the number of permitted turns. Based on our analysis, an attack strategy that focuses on removing the vertices with the highest betweenness value is most advantageous to the attacker. Power law graphs can become disconnected with the removal of a single edge; random graphs with the removal of as few as 1% of their vertices, small-world graphs with the removal of 14% vertices, and USW with the removal of 17% vertices. Watts - Strogatz small-world graphs are more robust and resilient than random or power law graphs. USW graphs are more robust and resilient than small world graphs. A graph of USW connected web objects (WOs) filled with data could outlive the individuals and institutions that created the data in an environment where WOs are lost due to random failures or directed attacks.",Digital Libraries
3960,Notations Around the World: Census and Exploitation,"Mathematical notations around the world are diverse. Not as much as requiring computing machines' makers to adapt to each culture, but as much as to disorient a person landing on a web-page with a text in mathematics. In order to understand better this diversity, we are building a census of notations: it should allow any content creator or mathematician to grasp which mathematical notation is used in which language and culture. The census is built collaboratively, collected in pages with a given semantic and presenting observations of the widespread notations being used in existing materials by a graphical extract. We contend that our approach should dissipate the fallacies found here and there about the notations in ""other cultures"" so that a better understanding of the cultures can be realized. The exploitation of the census in the math-bridge project is also presented: this project aims at taking learners ""where they are in their math-knowledge"" and bring them to a level ready to start engineering studies. The census serves as definitive reference for the transformation elements that generate the rendering of formul{\ae} in web-browsers.",Digital Libraries

How exactly to support this process so that it becomes as effortless as possible is one of the main unsolved problems of Mathematical Knowledge Management.   Two independent projects in formalization of mathematical content showed that many of the time consuming tasks could be significantly reduced if adequate tool support were available. It was also established that similar tasks are typical for object oriented languages and that they are to a large extent solved by Integrated Development Environments (IDE).   This thesis starts by analyzing the opportunities where formalization process can benefit from software support. A list of research questions is compiled along with a set of software requirements which are then used for developing a new IDE for the semantic \TeX{} (\stex{}) format. The result of the current research is that, indeed, IDEs can be very useful in the process of formalization and presents a set of best practices for implementing such IDEs.",Digital Libraries

In this paper, we analyze the relationships between impact factor, h-index, and g-index of a journal. To keep our analysis simple and easy to understand, we consider a generalized version of the impact factor where there is no time window. In the absence of the time window, the impact factor converges to the number of citations received per paper. This is not only justified for the impact factor, it simplifies the analysis of h-index and g-index as well because addition of a time window in the form of years complicates the computation of indices too. We derive the expressions for the relationships among impact factor, h-index, and g-index and validate them using a given set of publication-citation data.",Digital Libraries

Complex information management systems, like GIIDA, will take benefit from the use of terminological tools like thesauri that make available a reference lexicon for the indexing and retrieval of information. Within GIIDA the goal is to make available the EARTh thesaurus (Environmental Applications Reference Thesaurus), developed by the CNR-IIA-EKOLab. A web-based software, developed by the CNR-Water Research Institute (IRSA) was implemented to allow consultation and utilization of thesaurus through the web. This service is a useful tool to ensure interoperability between thesaurus and other systems of the indexing, with, the idea of cooperating to develop a comprehensive system of knowledge organization, that could be defined integrated, open, multi-functional and multilingual. Currently the system is available in multiple languages mode (Italian - English) and navigation can be done in the following ways: Alphabetical, Hierarchical and for Themes. A full search allows to find any term by searching for the whole term or a part of it and as well as allows to filter the results by themes. Within a collaborative initiative with the CNR-Institute of Applied Mathematics and Information Technology (IMATI) a SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System) version of EARTh was developed. This will ensure the possibility to support the use of the thesaurus within the framework of the Semantic Web in order to be used in decentralized metadata applications",Digital Libraries

We suggest that the set of citing papers first can be considered as the relevant representation of the field of impact. In order to normalize for differences in citation behavior among fields, citations can be fractionally counted proportionately to the length of the reference lists in the citing papers. This new method enables us to compare among units with different disciplinary affiliations at the paper level and also to assess the statistical significance of differences among sets. Twenty-seven departments of the Tsinghua University in Beijing are thus compared.

Using coauthorship data from 16 journals in the field of library and information science (LIS) with a time span of twenty years (1988-2007), we construct an evolving coauthorship network and calculate four centrality measures (closeness, betweenness, degree and PageRank) for authors in this network.

Measures of Scholarly Esteem,"Citation analysis does not generally take the quality of citations into account: all citations are weighted equally irrespective of source. However, a scholar may be highly cited but not highly regarded: popularity and prestige are not identical measures of esteem. In this study we define popularity as the number of times an author is cited and prestige as the number of times an author is cited by highly cited papers. Information Retrieval (IR) is the test field. We compare the 40 leading researchers in terms of their popularity and prestige over time. Some authors are ranked high on prestige but not on popularity, while others are ranked high on popularity but not on prestige. We also relate measures of popularity and prestige to date of Ph.D. award, number of key publications, organizational affiliation, receipt of prizes/honors, and gender.",Digital Libraries
3974,PageRank for ranking authors in co-citation networks,"Google's PageRank has created a new synergy to information retrieval for a better ranking of Web pages. It ranks documents depending on the topology of the graphs and the weights of the nodes. PageRank has significantly advanced the field of information retrieval and keeps Google ahead of competitors in the search engine market. It has been deployed in bibliometrics to evaluate research impact, yet few of these studies focus on the important impact of the damping factor (d) for ranking purposes. This paper studies how varied damping factors in the PageRank algorithm can provide additional insight into the ranking of authors in an author co-citation network. Furthermore, we propose weighted PageRank algorithms. We select 108 most highly cited authors in the information retrieval (IR) area from the 1970s to 2008 to form the author co-citation network. We calculate the ranks of these 108 authors based on PageRank with damping factor ranging from 0.05 to 0.95. In order to test the relationship between these different measures, we compare PageRank and weighted PageRank results with the citation ranking, h-index, and centrality measures. We found that in our author co-citation network, citation rank is highly correlated with PageRank's with different damping factors and also with different PageRank algorithms; citation rank and PageRank are not significantly correlated with centrality measures; and h-index is not significantly correlated with centrality measures.",Digital Libraries

  Indicators: Case Study in Colombia","Colombian scientific journals are poorly represented in international digital libraries; however, through Google Scholar (GS) it is possible to determine their use by the community. Between the years of 2003 and 2007 a classification of 185 Colombian journals indexed in the Colombian National Bibliographical Index (IBNP) was performed using the information provided by GS, basing categorization on size indicators, indexation and citation. The indicators were analyzed by grouping the journals in two general areas: sciences and social sciences. In each area, the indicators provided by the digital libraries Scopus, Redalyc and Scielo were compared. Additionally, the indicators provided by IBNP journals categories (A1, A2, B and C) were also compared. The sciences and social sciences had a similar pattern in their indicators. The existence of positive correlations was established between some indicators and they predicted that the number of citations per journal in GS and the h index depends on its visibility in GS and Scopus. We put forward that the current IBNP categories (A1, A2, B or C) faintly reflect the use of journals by the community and we propose a classification based on the h index as an infometric indicator, which reflects not only its visibility in Google Scholar, but also its inclusion in certain international digital libraries, particularly Scopus.

  Approach","In contrast to many other scientific disciplines, computer science considers conference publications.

Previous work on knowledge mapping focused on the map of all sciences or a particular domain based on ISI published JCR (Journal Citation Report). Although this data covers most of important journals, it lacks computer science conference and workshop proceedings. That results in an imprecise and incomplete analysis of the computer science knowledge. This paper presents an analysis on the computer science knowledge network constructed from all types of publications, aiming at providing a complete view of computer science research. Based on the combination of two important digital libraries (DBLP and CiteSeerX), we study the knowledge network created at journal/conference level using citation linkage, to identify the development of sub-disciplines. We investigate the collaborative and citation behavior of journals/conferences by analyzing the properties of their co-authorship and citation subgraphs.

Our empirical study measures the extent and growth of scientific globalisation in terms of physical distances between co-authoring researchers. Our analysis, drawing on 21 million research publications across all countries and fields of science, reveals that contemporary science has globalised at a fairly steady rate during recent decades. The average collaboration distance per publication has increased from 334 kilometres in 1980 to 1553 in 2009.

The model is designed from a set of requirements derived from the real world use cases of some of the largest digitized medieval content holders, and instantiations of the model are intended as the input to collection-independent page turning and scholarly presentation interfaces. A canvas painting paradigm, such as in PDF and SVG, was selected based on the lack of a one to one correlation between image and page, and to fulfill complex requirements such as when the full text of a page is known, but only fragments of the physical object remain. The model is implemented using technologies such as OAI-ORE Aggregations and OAC Annotations, as the fundamental building blocks of emerging Linked Digital Libraries.

Unfortunately, machine support for change management has either been very coarse grained and thus barely useful, or restricted to formal languages, where automation is possible. In this paper, we report on an effort to extend change management to collections of semi-formal documents which flexibly intermix mathematical formulas and natural language and to integrate it into a semantic publishing system for mathematical knowledge. We validate the long-standing assumption that the semantic annotations in these flexiformal documents that drive the machine-supported interaction with documents can support semantic impact analyses at the same time. But in contrast to the fully formal setting, where adaptations of impacted documents can be automated to some degree, the flexiformal setting requires much more user interaction and thus a much tighter integration into document management workflows.",Digital Libraries

We first discuss the pros and cons of the various options: cited versus citing, multidimensional scaling versus spring-embedded algorithms, VOSViewer versus Gephi, and the various clustering algorithms and similarity criteria. Our approach focuses on the positions of journals in the multidimensional space spanned by the aggregated journal-journal citations. A number of choices can be left to the user, but we provide default options reflecting our preferences. Some examples are also provided; for example, the potential of using this technique to assess the interdisciplinarity of organizations and/or document sets.",Digital Libraries
3992,"A recursive field-normalized bibliometric performance indicator: An
  application to the field of library and information science","Two commonly used ideas in the development of citation-based research performance indicators are the idea of normalizing citation counts based on a field classification scheme and the idea of recursive citation weighing (like in PageRank-inspired indicators). We combine these two ideas in a single indicator, referred to as the recursive mean normalized citation score indicator, and we study the validity of this indicator. Our empirical analysis shows that the proposed indicator is highly sensitive to the field classification scheme that is used. The indicator also has a strong tendency to reinforce biases caused by the classification scheme. Based on these observations, we advise against the use of indicators in which the idea of normalization based on a field classification scheme and the idea of recursive citation weighing are combined.",Digital Libraries

3994,Analyzing the Persistence of Referenced Web Resources with Memento,"In this paper we present the results of a study into the persistence and availability of web resources referenced from papers in scholarly repositories. Two repositories with different characteristics, arXiv and the UNT digital library, are studied to determine if the nature of the repository, or of its content, has a bearing on the availability of the web resources cited by that content. Memento makes it possible to automate discovery of archived resources and to consider the time between the publication of the research and the archiving of the referenced URLs. This automation allows us to process more than 160000 URLs, the largest known such study, and the repository metadata allows consideration of the results by discipline. The results are startling: 45% (66096) of the URLs referenced from arXiv still exist, but are not preserved for future generations, and 28% of resources referenced by UNT papers have been lost. Moving forwards, we provide some initial recommendations, including that repositories should publish URL lists extracted from papers that could be used as seeds for web archiving systems.",Digital Libraries

The distinctive characteristics of the proposed metric is that it is generic (it can be used to compare nodes of any kind), it takes into account the neighborhoods of the nodes, and it is configurable (with respect to the accuracy vs computational complexity tradeoff). We demonstrate the behavior of the metric using examples from an application over LOD. Finally, we generalize and elaborate on implementation approaches harmonized with the distributed nature of LOD which can be used for computing the most similar entities using neighborhood-based similarity metrics.",Digital Libraries

This should allow clients to easily publish and consume, thus exchange annotations about resources via common Web standards. We first present the current status of the Open Annotation Collaboration, an international initiative that is currently working on annotation interoperability specifications based on best practices from the Linked Data effort. Then we present two use cases and early prototypes that make use of the proposed annotation model and present lessons learned and discuss yet open technical issues.",Digital Libraries

One needs incursive routines in cogitantes to instantiate these systems. Unlike historical systems (with recursion), these hyper-incursive routines generate redundancies by opening horizons of other possible states. Thus, intentional systems can enrich our perceptions of the cases that have happened to occur. The perspective of hindsight codified at the above-individual level enables us furthermore to intervene technologically. The theory and computation of anticipatory systems have made these loops between supra-individual hyper-incursion, individual incursion (in instantiation), and historical recursion accessible for modeling and empirical investigation.",Digital Libraries

A multi-thesauri solution is proposed, based on a Common Thesaurus Framework for Nature Conservation, where different well-known Knowledge Organization Systems are assembled and shared. It has been designed according to semantic web and W3C recommendations employing SKOS standard models and Linked Data to publish the thesauri as a whole in machine-understandable format. The outcome is a powerful framework satisfying the requirements of modularity and openness for further thesaurus extension and updating, interlinking among thesauri, and exploitability from other systems.

In addition, their corresponding metadata and the software required to analyse or display them need to be archived. Yet the manual curation of research data can be difficult and expensive, particularly in very large digital repositories, hence the importance of models and tools for automating digital curation tasks. The automation of these tasks faces three major challenges: (1) research data and data sources are highly heterogeneous, (2) future research needs are difficult to anticipate, (3) data is hard to index. To address these problems, we propose the Extract, Transform and Archive (ETA) model for managing and mechanizing the curation of research data. Specifically, we propose a scalable strategy for addressing the research-data problem, ranging from the extraction of legacy data to its long-term storage. We review some existing solutions and propose novel avenues of research.",Digital Libraries

An analysis of their 1703 articles in 431 journals revealed substantial differences between the journal choices of these elite scientists and the ERA classification and ranking of journals.

  a Hybrid Approach","The creation of open archives i.e. archives where access is regulated by open licensing models (content, source, data), should be seen as part of a broader socio-economic phenomenon that finds legal expression in specific organizational and technical formats.This paper examines the origins and main characteristics of the open archives phenomenon. We investigate the extent to which different models of production of economic or social value can be expressed in different forms of licensing in the context of open archives. Through this process, we assess the extent to which the digital archive is moving towards providing access that is deeper (meaning, that offers more access rights) and wider (in the sense that most of the information given is in open content licensing) or face a gradual stratification and polarization of the content. Such stratification entails the emergence of two types of content: content to which access is extremely limited and content to which access remains completely open. This differentiation between classes of content is the result of multiple factors: from purely legislative, administrative and contractual restrictions (e.g. data protection and confidentiality restrictions) to information economics (e.g. peer production) or social (minimum universal access).   We claim that with respect to the access management model, most of the current archiving processes include elements of openness. Usually, this is the result of economic necessity expressed in licensing instruments or organisational arrangements. The viability and the socio-economic importance of the digital archives also contributes to the use of open archiving practices. In such a context, although pure forms of open digital archives may remain an ideal, the reality of hybrid open digital archives is a necessity.",Digital Libraries

However, citation distributions are skewed, and the average has the disadvantage that the number of publications is used in the denominator. Using hundred percentiles, one can integrate the normalized citation curve and develop an indicator that can be compared across document sets because percentile ranks are defined at the article level. I apply this indicator to the set of 58 journals in the ISI Subject Category of ""Nanoscience & nanotechnology,"" and rank journals, countries, cities, and institutes using non-parametric statistics. The significance levels of results can thus be indicated.

Critically, we must identify the digital objects that are only referenced in the source data, but are embedded in the performance, such as fonts. This paper describes a new technique for analysing the dynamic dependencies of digital media, focussing on analysing the process that underlies the performance, rather than parsing and deconstructing the source data.

  Assignment Features","This paper proposes an architecture and assignment management model of a conference management system that performs a precise and accurate automatic assignment of reviewers to papers. The system relies on taxonomy of keywords to describe papers and reviewers' competences. The implied hierarchical structure of the taxonomy provides important additional information - the semantic relationships between the separate keywords. It allows similarity measures to take into account not only the number of exactly matching keywords between a paper and a reviewer, but in case of non-matching ones to calculate how semantically close they are. Reviewers are allowed to bid on the papers they would like to (or not like to) review and to explicitly state conflicts of interest (CoI) with papers. An automatic CoI detection is checking for additional conflicts based on institutional affiliation, co-authorship (within the local database) and previous co-authorship in the past (within the major bibliographic indexes and digital libraries). The algorithm for automatic assignment takes into account all - selected keywords, reviewers' bids and conflicts of interest and tries to find the most accurate assignment while maintaining load balancing among reviewers.",Digital Libraries

The digital preservation community's attempt to expound on the general characteristics of digital objects and significant properties will then be discussed. Finally, the review shows that while there may be ways to identify the technical makeup or general characteristics of a digital object, there is currently no formal and objective methodology to help stakeholders identify and decide what the significant properties of the objects are.

  Ontological Approach","Even though library and archival practice, as well as Digital Preservation, have a long tradition in identifying information objects, the question of their precise identity under change of carrier or migration is still a riddle to science. The objective of this paper is to provide criteria for the unique identification of some important kinds of information objects, independent from the kind of carrier or specific encoding. Our approach is based on the idea that the substance of some kinds of information objects can completely be described in terms of discrete arrangements of finite numbers of known kinds of symbols, such as those implied by style guides for scientific journal submissions. Our theory is also useful for selecting or describing what has to be preserved. This is a fundamental problem since curators and archivists would like to formally record the decisions of what has to be preserved over time and to decide (or verify) whether a migration (transformation) preserves the intended information content. Furthermore, it is important for reasoning about the authenticity of digital objects, as well as for reducing the cost of digital preservation.",Digital Libraries

Furthermore, the mean-or any central-tendency statistics-is not a good representation of the citation distribution because these distributions are skewed. Important steps have been taken to solve these two problems during the last few years. First, one can normalize at the article level using the citing audience as the reference set. Second, one can use non-parametric statistics for testing the significance of differences among ratings.

All three, the SJR2 indicator, the SNIP indicator and the JIF distributions, were found to fit well to a logarithmic law. Although the three metrics were strongly correlated, there were major changes in rank. In addition, the SJR2 was distributed more equalized than the JIF by Subject Area and almost as equalized as the SNIP, and better than both at the lower level of Specific Subject Areas.

Also, a detailed description is offered of the data collection methodology of the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 and of the indicators used in the ranking. Various innovations in the Leiden Ranking 2011/2012 are presented. These innovations include (1) an indicator based on counting a university's highly cited publications, (2) indicators based on fractional rather than full counting of collaborative publications, (3) the possibility of excluding non-English language publications, and (4) the use of stability intervals. Finally, some comments are made on the interpretation of the ranking, and a number of limitations of the ranking are pointed out.",Digital Libraries
4033,McCall's Area Transformation versus the Integrated Impact Indicator (I3),"In a study entitled ""Skewed Citation Distributions and Bias Factors: Solutions to two core problems with the journal impact factor,"" Mutz & Daniel (2012) propose (i) McCall's (1922) Area Transformation of the skewed citation distribution so that this data can be considered as normally distributed (Krus & Kennedy, 1977), and (ii) to control for different document types as a co-variate (Rubin, 1977). This approach provides an alternative to Leydesdorff & Bornmann's (2011) Integrated Impact Indicator (I3). As the authors note, the two approaches are akin.   Can something be said about the relative quality of the two approaches? To that end, I replicated the study of Mutz & Daniel for the 11 journals in the Subject Category ""mathematical psychology,"" but using additionally I3 on the basis of continuous quantiles (Leydesdorff & Bornmann, in press) and its variant PR6 based on the six percentile rank classes distinguished by Bornmann & Mutz (2011) as follows: the top-1%, 95-99%, 90-95%, 75-90%, 50-75%, and bottom-50%.",Digital Libraries

However, these portals are usually closed systems and user-generated annotations are almost always kept locked up and remain inaccessible to the Web of Data. We believe that an important step to take is the integration of multimedia annotations and the Linked Data principles. We present the current state of the Open Annotation Model, explain our design rationale, and describe how the model can represent user annotations on multimedia Web resources. Applying this model in Web portals and devices, which support user annotations, should allow clients to easily publish and consume, thus exchange annotations on multimedia Web resources via common Web standards.",Digital Libraries
4035,"A new methodology for constructing a publication-level classification
  system of science","Classifying journals or publications into research areas is an essential element of many bibliometric analyses. Classification usually takes place at the level of journals, where the Web of Science subject categories are the most popular classification system. However, journal-level classification systems have two important limitations: They offer only a limited amount of detail, and they have difficulties with multidisciplinary journals. To avoid these limitations, we introduce a new methodology for constructing classification systems at the level of individual publications. In the proposed methodology, publications are clustered into research areas based on citation relations. The methodology is able to deal with very large numbers of publications. We present an application in which a classification system is produced that includes almost ten million publications. Based on an extensive analysis of this classification system, we discuss the strengths and the limitations of the proposed methodology. Important strengths are the transparency and relative simplicity of the methodology and its fairly modest computing and memory requirements. The main limitation of the methodology is its exclusive reliance on direct citation relations between publications. The accuracy of the methodology can probably be increased by also taking into account other types of relations, for instance based on bibliographic coupling.",Digital Libraries

Focusing on three main branches-""diseases,"" ""drugs and chemicals,"" and ""techniques and equipment""-we use base maps and overlay techniques to investigate the translations and interactions and thus to gain a bibliometric perspective on the dynamics of medical innovations. To this end, we first analyze the Medline database, the MeSH index tree, and the various options for a static mapping from different perspectives and at different levels of aggregation. Following a specific innovation (RNA interference) over time, the notion of a trajectory which leaves a signature in the database is elaborated. Can the detailed index terms describing the dynamics of research be used to predict the diffusion dynamics of research results? Possibilities are specified for further integration between the Medline database, on the one hand, and the Science Citation Index and Scopus (containing citation information), on the other.",Digital Libraries

4038,Metadata Management in Scientific Computing,"Complex scientific codes and the datasets they generate are in need of a sophisticated categorization environment that allows the community to store, search, and enhance metadata in an open, dynamic system. Currently, data is often presented in a read-only format, distilled and curated by a select group of researchers. We envision a more open and dynamic system, where authors can publish their data in a writeable format, allowing users to annotate the datasets with their own comments and data. This would enable the scientific community to collaborate on a higher level than before, where researchers could for example annotate a published dataset with their citations.   Such a system would require a complete set of permissions to ensure that any individual's data cannot be altered by others unless they specifically allow it. For this reason datasets and codes are generally presented read-only, to protect the author's data; however, this also prevents the type of social revolutions that the private sector has seen with Facebook and Twitter.   In this paper, we present an alternative method of publishing codes and datasets, based on Fluidinfo, which is an openly writeable and social metadata engine. We will use the specific example of the Einstein Toolkit, a shared scientific code built using the Cactus Framework, to illustrate how the code's metadata may be published in writeable form via Fluidinfo.",Digital Libraries

  globalization processes worldwide","This paper applies a new model and analytical tool to measure and study contemporary globalization processes in collaborative science - a world in which scientists, scholars, technicians and engineers interact within a 'grid' of interconnected research sites and collaboration networks. The building blocks of our metrics are the cities where scientific research is conducted, as mentioned in author addresses on research publications. The unit of analysis is the geographical distance between those cities. In our macro-level trend analysis, covering the years 2000-2010, we observe that research collaboration distances have been increasing, while the share of collaborative contacts with foreign cities has leveled off. Collaboration distances and growth rates differ significantly between countries and between fields of science. The application of a distance metrics to compare and track these processes opens avenues for further studies, both at the meso-level and at the micro-level, into how research collaboration patterns and trends are driving and shaping the connectivity fabric of world science.",Digital Libraries

This freeware routine is applied to the case of ""Brugada Syndrome,"" a specific disease and field of research (since 1992). The journals containing these publications, for example, are attributed to Web-of-Science Categories other than ""Cardiac and Cardiovascular Systems""), perhaps because of the possibility of genetic testing for this syndrome in the clinic. With this routine, all the instruments available for citation analysis can now be used on the basis of MeSH terms.

4041,Altmetrics in the wild: Using social media to explore scholarly impact,"In growing numbers, scholars are integrating social media tools like blogs, Twitter, and Mendeley into their professional communications. The online, public nature of these tools exposes and reifies scholarly processes once hidden and ephemeral. Metrics based on this activities could inform broader, faster measures of impact, complementing traditional citation metrics. This study explores the properties of these social media-based metrics or ""altmetrics"", sampling 24,331 articles published by the Public Library of Science.   We find that that different indicators vary greatly in activity. Around 5% of sampled articles are cited in Wikipedia, while close to 80% have been included in at least one Mendeley library. There is, however, an encouraging diversity; a quarter of articles have nonzero data from five or more different sources. Correlation and factor analysis suggest citation and altmetrics indicators track related but distinct impacts, with neither able to describe the complete picture of scholarly use alone. There are moderate correlations between Mendeley and Web of Science citation, but many altmetric indicators seem to measure impact mostly orthogonal to citation. Articles cluster in ways that suggest five different impact ""flavors"", capturing impacts of different types on different audiences; for instance, some articles may be heavily read and saved by scholars but seldom cited. Together, these findings encourage more research into altmetrics as complements to traditional citation measures.",Digital Libraries
4042,"Building Custom Term Suggestion Web Services with OAI-Harvested Open
  Data","The problem that the same information need can be expressed in a variety of ways is especially true for scientific literature. Each scientific discipline has its own domain-specific language and vocabulary. This language is coded into documentary tools like thesauri or classifications that are used to document and describe scientific documents. When we think of information retrieval as ""fundamentally a linguistic process"" (Blair, 2003) users have to be aware of the most relevant search terms - which are the controlled thesauri terms the documents are described with. This can be achieved with so-called search-term-recommenders (STR) that map free search terms of a lay user to controlled vocabulary terms which can then be used as a term suggestion or to do an automatic query expansion (Hienert, Schaer, Schaible, & Mayr, 2011). State-of-the-art repository software systems like DSpace or EPrints already offer some kind of term suggestion features in search or input forms but these implementations only work as simple auto completion mechanisms that don't incorporate any kind of semantic mapping. Such software systems would gain a lot in terms of usability and data consistency if tools like the proposed domain-specific STRs would be freely available. We aim to implement a rich toolbox of web services (like the mentioned domain-specific STRs) to support users and providers of online Digital Library (DL) or repository systems.",Digital Libraries

  (BKCI) and Science Citation Index (SCI, SoSCI, A&HCI)","In 2011, Thomson-Reuters introduced the Book Citation Index (BKCI) as part of the Science Citation Index (SCI). The interface of the Web of Science version 5 enables users to search for both ""Books"" and ""Book Chapters"" as new categories. Books and book chapters, however, were always among the cited references, and book chapters have been included in the database since 2005. We explore the two categories with both BKCI and SCI, and in the sister social sciences (SoSCI) and the arts & humanities (A&HCI) databases. Book chapters in edited volumes can be highly cited. Books contain many citing references but are relatively less cited. This may find its origin in the slower circulation of books than of journal articles. It is possible to distinguish between monographs and edited volumes among the ""Books"" scientometrically. Monographs may be underrated in terms of citation impact or overrated using publication performance indicators because individual chapters are counted as contributions separately in terms of articles, reviews, and/or book chapters.",Digital Libraries

  An Assessment in terms of Percentile Ranks and Fractional Counts","Using the CD-ROM version of the Science Citation Index 2010 (N = 3,705 journals), we study the (combined) effects of (i) fractional counting on the impact factor (IF) and (ii) transformation of the skewed citation distributions into a distribution of 100 percentiles and six percentile rank classes (top-1%, top-5%, etc.). Do these approaches lead to field-normalized impact measures for journals? In addition to the two-year IF (IF2), we consider the five-year IF (IF5), the respective numerators of these IFs, and the number of Total Cites, counted both as integers and fractionally. These various indicators are tested against the hypothesis that the classification of journals into 11 broad fields by PatentBoard/National Science Foundation provides statistically significant between-field effects. Using fractional counting the between-field variance is reduced by 91.7% in the case of IF5, and by 79.2% in the case of IF2. However, the differences in citation counts are not significantly affected by fractional counting. These results accord with previous studies, but the longer citation window of a fractionally counted IF5 can lead to significant improvement in the normalization across fields.",Digital Libraries

A debate among scientometricians about proper normalization of citation counts has resolved with the creation of an Integrated Impact Indicator (I3) that solves a number of problems found among previously used indicators. The I3 applies non-parametric statistics using percentiles, allowing highly-cited papers to be weighted more than less-cited ones. It further allows unbundling of venues (i.e., journals or databases) at the article level. Measures at the article level can be re-aggregated in terms of units of evaluation. At the venue level, the I3 creates a properly weighted alternative to the journal impact factor. I3 has the added advantage of enabling and quantifying classifications such as the six percentile rank classes used by the National Science Board's Science & Engineering Indicators.",Digital Libraries

4050,"Green and Gold Open Access Percentages and Growth, by Discipline","Most refereed journal articles today are published in subscription journals, accessible only to subscribing institutions, hence losing considerable research impact. Making articles freely accessible online (""Open Access,"" OA) maximizes their impact. Articles can be made OA in two ways: by self-archiving them on the web (""Green OA"") or by publishing them in OA journals (""Gold OA""). We compared the percent and growth rate of Green and Gold OA for 14 disciplines in two random samples of 1300 articles per discipline out of the 12,500 journals indexed by Thomson-Reuters-ISI using a robot that trawled the web for OA full-texts. We sampled in 2009 and 2011 for publication year ranges 1998-2006 and 2005-2010, respectively. Green OA (21.4%) exceeds Gold OA (2.4%) in proportion and growth rate in all but the biomedical disciplines, probably because it can be provided for all journals articles and does not require paying extra Gold OA publication fees. The spontaneous overall OA growth rate is still very slow (about 1% per year). If institutions make Green OA self-archiving mandatory, however, it triples percent Green OA as well as accelerating its growth rate.",Digital Libraries

4052,"An empirical analysis of the use of alphabetical authorship in
  scientific publishing","There are different ways in which the authors of a scientific publication can determine the order in which their names are listed. Sometimes author names are simply listed alphabetically. In other cases, authorship order is determined based on the contribution authors have made to a publication. Contribution-based authorship can facilitate proper credit assignment, for instance by giving most credits to the first author. In the case of alphabetical authorship, nothing can be inferred about the relative contribution made by the different authors of a publication. In this paper, we present an empirical analysis of the use of alphabetical authorship in scientific publishing. Our analysis covers all fields of science. We find that the use of alphabetical authorship is declining over time. In 2011, the authors of less than 4% of all publications intentionally chose to list their names alphabetically. The use of alphabetical authorship is most common in mathematics, economics (including finance), and high energy physics. Also, the use of alphabetical authorship is relatively more common in the case of publications with either a small or a large number of authors.",Digital Libraries

4055,A Revised Publication Model for ECML PKDD,"ECML PKDD is the main European conference on machine learning and data mining. Since its foundation it implemented the publication model common in computer science: there was one conference deadline; conference submissions were reviewed by a program committee; papers were accepted with a low acceptance rate. Proceedings were published in several Springer Lecture Notes in Artificial (LNAI) volumes, while selected papers were invited to special issues of the Machine Learning and Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery journals. In recent years, this model has however come under stress. Problems include: reviews are of highly variable quality; the purpose of bringing the community together is lost; reviewing workloads are high; the information content of conferences and journals decreases; there is confusion among scientists in interdisciplinary contexts. In this paper, we present a new publication model, which will be adopted for the ECML PKDD 2013 conference, and aims to solve some of the problems of the traditional model. The key feature of this model is the creation of a journal track, which is open to submissions all year long and allows for revision cycles.",Digital Libraries

4059,"Source normalized indicators of citation impact: An overview of
  different approaches and an empirical comparison","Different scientific fields have different citation practices. Citation-based bibliometric indicators need to normalize for such differences between fields in order to allow for meaningful between-field comparisons of citation impact. Traditionally, normalization for field differences has usually been done based on a field classification system. In this approach, each publication belongs to one or more fields and the citation impact of a publication is calculated relative to the other publications in the same field. Recently, the idea of source normalization was introduced, which offers an alternative approach to normalize for field differences. In this approach, normalization is done by looking at the referencing behavior of citing publications or citing journals. In this paper, we provide an overview of a number of source normalization approaches and we empirically compare these approaches with a traditional normalization approach based on a field classification system. We also pay attention to the issue of the selection of the journals to be included in a normalization for field differences. Our analysis indicates a number of problems of the traditional classification-system-based normalization approach, suggesting that source normalization approaches may yield more accurate results.",Digital Libraries

Thus, we explore ways of capturing more of the structure of research in reports about the research and we use that structure to support the development of a new generation of document browsers which include novel interaction widgets. We apply the browsers incorporating the conceptual modeling framework to full-text research reports from the Public Library of Science (PLoS).

4061,Some modifications to the SNIP journal impact indicator,"The SNIP (source normalized impact per paper) indicator is an indicator of the citation impact of scientific journals. The indicator, introduced by Henk Moed in 2010, is included in Elsevier's Scopus database. The SNIP indicator uses a source normalized approach to correct for differences in citation practices between scientific fields. The strength of this approach is that it does not require a field classification system in which the boundaries of fields are explicitly defined. In this paper, a number of modifications that will be made to the SNIP indicator are explained, and the advantages of the resulting revised SNIP indicator are pointed out. It is argued that the original SNIP indicator has some counterintuitive properties, and it is shown mathematically that the revised SNIP indicator does not have these properties. Empirically, the differences between the original SNIP indicator and the revised one turn out to be relatively small, although some systematic differences can be observed. Relations with other source normalized indicators proposed in the literature are discussed as well.",Digital Libraries

Unfortunately, the technology for publishing information on the web always outstrips our technology for preservation. My concern is less that we will lose data of known importance (e.g., scientific data, census data), but rather that we will lose data that we do not yet know is important.

In this essay, I argue that peer review as currently practiced conflates the sensible idea of getting comments on a paper with the irrevocably-flawed one that we either accept or reject the paper, which I term gatekeeping. If we look at the two separately, then it is clear that the ills associated with current peer review systems are not due to the practice of getting comments, but due to the practice of gatekeeping.   True peer review constitutes my proposal for replacing existing peer review systems. It embraces the idea of open debate on the merits of a paper; however, it rejects unequivocally the exercise of gatekeeping. True peer review offers all the benefits of current peer review systems but has none of its weaknesses. True peer review will lead to a truly engaged community of researchers and therefore better science.",Digital Libraries

We split JASIST into document sets containing iMetrics and general IS articles. The volume of publications in this representation of the specialty has increased rapidly during the last decade. A core of researchers that predominantly focus on iMetrics topics can thus be identified.

In this paper we propose an alternative method called age-sensitive bibliographic coupling: the aim is to enable the standard method to produce historically valid thematic units, that is, to yield document clusters that represent the historical development of the thematic structure of the subject as well.

4067,"Citation analysis may severely underestimate the impact of clinical
  research as compared to basic research","Background: Citation analysis has become an important tool for research performance assessment in the medical sciences. However, different areas of medical research may have considerably different citation practices, even within the same medical field. Because of this, it is unclear to what extent citation-based bibliometric indicators allow for valid comparisons between research units active in different areas of medical research.   Methodology: A visualization methodology is introduced that reveals differences in citation practices between medical research areas. The methodology extracts terms from the titles and abstracts of a large collection of publications and uses these terms to visualize the structure of a medical field and to indicate how research areas within this field differ from each other in their average citation impact.   Results: Visualizations are provided for 32 medical fields, defined based on journal subject categories in the Web of Science database. The analysis focuses on three fields. In each of these fields, there turn out to be large differences in citation practices between research areas. Low-impact research areas tend to focus on clinical intervention research, while high-impact research areas are often more oriented on basic and diagnostic research.   Conclusions: Popular bibliometric indicators, such as the h-index and the impact factor, do not correct for differences in citation practices between medical fields. These indicators therefore cannot be used to make accurate between-field comparisons. More sophisticated bibliometric indicators do correct for field differences but still fail to take into account within-field heterogeneity in citation practices. As a consequence, the citation impact of clinical intervention research may be substantially underestimated in comparison with basic and diagnostic research.",Digital Libraries

Building on the Innovation Accelerator paper by Helbing and Balietti (2011) this paper takes the initial global vision and reviews the theoretical and technological building blocks that can be used for implementing an innovation (in first place: science) accelerator platform driven by re-imagining the science system. The envisioned platform would rest on four pillars: (i) Redesign the incentive scheme to reduce behavior such as conservatism, herding and hyping; (ii) Advance scientific publications by breaking up the monolithic paper unit and introducing other building blocks such as data, tools, experiment workflows, resources; (iii) Use machine readable semantics for publications, debate structures, provenance etc. in order to include the computer as a partner in the scientific process, and (iv) Build an online platform for collaboration, including a network of trust and reputation among the different types of stakeholders in the scientific system: scientists, educators, funding agencies, policy makers, students and industrial innovators among others. Any such improvements to the scientific system must support the entire scientific process (unlike current tools that chop up the scientific process into disconnected pieces), must facilitate and encourage collaboration and interdisciplinarity (again unlike current tools), must facilitate the inclusion of intelligent computing in the scientific process, must facilitate not only the core scientific process, but also accommodate other stakeholders such science policy makers, industrial innovators, and the general public.",Digital Libraries
4069,Formats over Time: Exploring UK Web History,"Is software obsolescence a significant risk? To explore this issue, we analysed a corpus of over 2.5 billion resources corresponding to the UK Web domain, as crawled between 1996 and 2010. Using the DROID and Apache Tika identification tools, we examined each resource and captured the results as extended MIME types, embedding version, software and hardware identifiers alongside the format information. The combined results form a detailed temporal format profile of the corpus, which we have made available as open data. We present the results of our initial analysis of this dataset. We look at image, HTML and PDF resources in some detail, showing how the usage of different formats, versions and software implementations has changed over time. Furthermore, we show that software obsolescence is rare on the web and uncover evidence indicating that network effects act to stabilise formats against obsolescence.",Digital Libraries

  International Patent Classifications (IPC)","We report on the development of an interface to the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) that allows for the mapping of patent portfolios as overlays to basemaps constructed from citation relations among all patents contained in this database during the period 1976-2011. Both the interface and the data are in the public domain; the freeware programs VOSViewer and/or Pajek can be used for the visualization. These basemaps and overlays can be generated at both the 3-digit and 4-digit levels of the International Patent Classifications (IPC) of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). The basemaps can provide a stable mental framework for analysts to follow developments over searches for different years, which can be animated. The full flexibility of the advanced search engines of USPTO are available for generating sets of patents and/or patent applications which can thus be visualized and compared. This instrument allows for addressing questions about technological distance, diversity in portfolios, and animating the developments of both technologies and technological capacities of organizations over time.",Digital Libraries
4072,Testing the Finch Hypothesis on Green OA Mandate Ineffectiveness,"We have now tested the Finch Committee's Hypothesis that Green Open Access Mandates are ineffective in generating deposits in institutional repositories. With data from ROARMAP on institutional Green OA mandates and data from ROAR on institutional repositories, we show that deposit number and rate is significantly correlated with mandate strength (classified as 1-12): The stronger the mandate, the more the deposits. The strongest mandates generate deposit rates of 70%+ within 2 years of adoption, compared to the un-mandated deposit rate of 20%. The effect is already detectable at the national level, where the UK, which has the largest proportion of Green OA mandates, has a national OA rate of 35%, compared to the global baseline of 25%. The conclusion is that, contrary to the Finch Hypothesis, Green Open Access Mandates do have a major effect, and the stronger the mandate, the stronger the effect (the Liege ID/OA mandate, linked to research performance evaluation, being the strongest mandate model). RCUK (as well as all universities, research institutions and research funders worldwide) would be well advised to adopt the strongest Green OA mandates and to integrate institutional and funder mandates.",Digital Libraries
4073,"Field-normalized Impact Factors: A Comparison of Rescaling versus
  Fractionally Counted IFs","Two methods for comparing impact factors and citation rates across fields of science are tested against each other using citations to the 3,705 journals in the Science Citation Index 2010 (CD-Rom version of SCI) and the 13 field categories used for the Science and Engineering Indicators of the US National Science Board. We compare (i) normalization by counting citations in proportion to the length of the reference list (1/N of references) with (ii) rescaling by dividing citation scores by the arithmetic mean of the citation rate of the cluster. Rescaling is analytical and therefore independent of the quality of the attribution to the sets, whereas fractional counting provides an empirical strategy for normalization among sets (by evaluating the between-group variance). By the fairness test of Radicchi & Castellano (2012a), rescaling outperforms fractional counting of citations for reasons that we consider.",Digital Libraries

In order to alert the research community over how easily one can manipulate the data and bibliometric indicators offered by Google s products we present an experiment in which we manipulate the Google Citations profiles of a research group through the creation of false documents that cite their documents, and consequently, the journals in which they have published modifying their H index. For this purpose we created six documents authored by a faked author and we uploaded them to a researcher s personal website under the University of Granadas domain. The result of the experiment meant an increase of 774 citations in 129 papers (six citations per paper) increasing the authors and journals H index. We analyse the malicious effect this type of practices can cause to Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics. Finally, we conclude with several deliberations over the effects these malpractices may have and the lack of control tools these tools offer",Digital Libraries

The fluidity and fuzziness of the interdisciplinary delineations in the different visualizations can be reduced and clarified using factor analysis. We also explore newly available routines (""CorText"") to analyze this development in terms of ""tubes"" using an alluvial map, and compare the results with an animation (using ""visone""). The historical specificity of this development can be compared with the development of ""artificial intelligence"" into an integrated specialty during this same period.

The paper introduces a model that relates base concepts in the study of migration to bibliometric constructs, and discusses the potentialities and limitations of a bibliometric approach both with respect to data accuracy and interpretation. Synchronous and asynchronous analyses are presented for 10 rapidly growing countries and 7 scientifically established countries. Rough error rates of the proposed indicators are estimated. It is concluded that the bibliometric approach is promising provided that its outcomes are interpreted with care, based on insight into the limits and potentialities of the bibliometric approach, and combined with complementary data, obtained, for instance, from researchers Curricula Vitae or survey or questionnaire based data. Error rates for units of assessment with indicator values based on sufficiently large numbers are estimated to be fairly below 10 per cent, but can be expected to vary substantially among countries of origin, especially between Asian countries and Western countries.",Digital Libraries
4081,"Identifying Research Fields within Business and Management: A Journal
  Cross-Citation Analysis","A discipline such as business and management (B&M) is very broad and has many fields within it, ranging from fairly scientific ones such as management science or economics to softer ones such as information systems. There are at least two reasons why it is important to identify these sub-fields accurately. Firstly, for the purpose of normalizing citation data as it is well known that citation rates vary significantly between different disciplines. Secondly, because journal rankings and lists tend to split their classifications into different subjects, for example the the Association of Business Schools (ABS) list, which is a standard in the UK, has 22 different fields. Unfortunately, at the moment these are created in an ad hoc manner with no underlying rigour. The purpose of this paper is to identify possible sub-fields in B&M rigorously based on actual citation patterns. We have examined 450 journals in B&M which are included in the ISI Web of Science (WoS) and analysed the cross-citation rates between them enabling us to generate sets of coherent and consistent sub-fields that minimise the extent to which journals appear in several categories. Implications and limitations of the analysis are discussed",Digital Libraries

Between 40 and 50 countries appear in the center of the international network in 2011, and almost all (201) nations are nowadays involved in international collaboration. In this brief communication, we present both a global map with the functionality of a Google Map (zooming, etc.) and network maps based on normalized relations. These maps reveal complementary aspects of the network. International collaboration in the generation of knowledge claims (that is, the context of discovery) changes the structural layering of the sciences. Previously, validation was at the global level and discovery more dependent on local contexts. This changing relationship between the geographical and intellectual dimensions of the sciences also has implications for national science policies.",Digital Libraries
4083,"Interactive Overlays of Journals and the Measurement of
  Interdisciplinarity on the basis of Aggregated Journal-Journal Citations","Using ""Analyze Results"" at the Web of Science, one can directly generate overlays onto global journal maps of science. The maps are based on the 10,000+ journals contained in the Journal Citation Reports (JCR) of the Science and Social Science Citation Indices (2011). The disciplinary diversity of the retrieval is measured in terms of Rao-Stirling's ""quadratic entropy."" Since this indicator of interdisciplinarity is normalized between zero and one, the interdisciplinarity can be compared among document sets and across years, cited or citing. The colors used for the overlays are based on Blondel et al.'s (2008) community-finding algorithms operating on the relations journals included in JCRs. The results can be exported from VOSViewer with different options such as proportional labels, heat maps, or cluster density maps. The maps can also be web-started and/or animated (e.g., using PowerPoint). The ""citing"" dimension of the aggregated journal-journal citation matrix was found to provide a more comprehensive description than the matrix based on the cited archive. The relations between local and global maps and their different functions in studying the sciences in terms of journal litteratures are further discussed: local and global maps are based on different assumptions and can be expected to serve different purposes for the explanation.",Digital Libraries

We pay special attention to the selection of the publications included in the analysis. Publications in national scientific journals, popular scientific magazines, and trade magazines are not included. Unlike earlier studies, we use algorithmically constructed classification systems to evaluate the different normalization approaches. Our analysis shows that a source normalization approach based on the recently introduced idea of fractional citation counting does not perform well. Two other source normalization approaches generally outperform the classification-system-based normalization approach that we study. Our analysis therefore offers considerable support for the use of source-normalized bibliometric indicators.",Digital Libraries

The publication data are collected from MyAis (Malaysian Abstracting & Indexing system) while the citation data are collected from Google Scholar. The values of the synchronous JDF ranges from 0.057 - 0.14 while the diachronous JDF ranges from 0.46 - 1.98. The high diachronous JDF is explained by a relatively high number of different citing journals against the number of publications. This implies that the results of diachronous JDF is influenced by the numbers of publications and a good comparison may be one of which the subject of analysis have similar number of publications and citations period. The yearly values of the synchronous RDF vary in the range of 0.66 - 1.00 while diachronous RDF ranges from 0.62 - 0.88. The result shows that diachronous RDF is negatively correlated with the number of citations, resulting in a low RDF value for highly cited publication years. What this implies in practice is that the diffusion factors can be calculated for every additional year at any journal level of analysis. This study demonstrates that these indicators are valuable tools that help to show development of journals as it changes through time.",Digital Libraries

This study focuses on clinical practice guidelines, which are supposed to gather the highest evidence on a given topic to give the best possible recommendation for practitioners. The quality of clinical practice guidelines, measured using the AGREE score, is compared to the citations given to the references used in these guidelines, as it is hypothesised, that better guidelines are based on higher cited references. AGREE scores are gathered from reviews of clinical practice guidelines on a number of diseases and treatments. Their references are collected from Web of Science and citation counts are normalised using the item-oriented z-score and the PPtop-10% indicators. A positive correlation between both citation indicators and the AGREE score of clinical practice guidelines is found. Some potential confounding factors are identified.

4097,"Mutual Redundancies in Inter-human Communication Systems: Steps Towards
  a Calculus of Processing Meaning","The study of inter-human communication requires a more complex framework than Shannon's (1948) mathematical theory of communication because ""information"" is defined in the latter case as meaningless uncertainty. Assuming that meaning cannot be communicated, we extend Shannon's theory by defining mutual redundancy as a positional counterpart of the relational communication of information. Mutual redundancy indicates the surplus of meanings that can be provided to the exchanges in reflexive communications. The information is redundant because based on ""pure sets,"" that is, without subtraction of mutual information in the overlaps. We show that in the three-dimensional case (e.g., of a Triple Helix of university-industry-government relations), mutual redundancy is equal to mutual information (Rxyz = Txyz); but when the dimensionality is even, the sign is different. We generalize to the measurement in N dimensions and proceed to the interpretation. Using Luhmann's social-systems theory and/or Giddens' structuration theory, mutual redundancy can be provided with an interpretation in the sociological case: different meaning-processing structures code and decode with other algorithms. A surplus of (""absent"") options can then be generated that add to the redundancy. Luhmann's ""functional (sub)systems"" of expectations or Giddens' ""rule-resource sets"" are positioned mutually, but coupled operationally in events or ""instantiated"" in actions. Shannon-type information is generated by the mediation, but the ""structures"" are (re-)positioned towards one another as sets of (potentially counterfactual) expectations. The structural differences among the coding and decoding algorithms provide a source of additional options in reflexive and anticipatory communications.",Digital Libraries

4104,Are elite journals declining?,"Previous work indicates that over the past 20 years, the highest quality work have been published in an increasingly diverse and larger group of journals. In this paper we examine whether this diversification has also affected the handful of elite journals that are traditionally considered to be the best. We examine citation patterns over the past 40 years of 7 long-standing traditionally elite journals and 6 journals that have been increasing in importance over the past 20 years. To be among the top 5% or 1% cited papers, papers now need about twice as many citations as they did 40 years ago. Since the late 1980s and early 1990s elite journals have been publishing a decreasing proportion of these top cited papers. This also applies to the two journals that are typically considered as the top venues and often used as bibliometric indicators of ""excellence"", Science and Nature. On the other hand, several new and established journals are publishing an increasing proportion of most cited papers. These changes bring new challenges and opportunities for all parties. Journals can enact policies to increase or maintain their relative position in the journal hierarchy. Researchers now have the option to publish in more diverse venues knowing that their work can still reach the same audiences. Finally, evaluators and administrators need to know that although there will always be a certain prestige associated with publishing in ""elite"" journals, journal hierarchies are in constant flux so inclusion of journals into this group is not permanent.",Digital Libraries

Open Annotations can easily be shared between platforms, with sufficient richness of expression to satisfy complex requirements while remaining simple enough to also allow for the most common use cases, such as attaching a piece of text to a single web resource.

It also motivates interoperable Annotations via use cases, and provides a brief analysis of the advantages over previous specifications.",Digital Libraries
4106,A bibliometric index based on the complete list of cited publications,"We propose a new index, the $j$-index, which is defined for an author as the sum of the square roots of the numbers of citations to each of the author's publications. The idea behind the $j$-index it to remedy a drawback of the $h$-index $-$ that the $h$-index does not take into account the full citation record of a researcher. The square root function is motivated by our desire to avoid the possible bias that may occur with a simple sum when an author has several very highly cited papers. We compare the $j$-index to the $h$-index, the $g$-index and the total citation count for three subject areas using several association measures.   Our results indicate that that the association between the $j$-index and the other indices varies according to the subject area. One explanation of this variation may be due to the proportion of citations to publications of the researcher that are in the $h$-core. The $j$-index is {\em not} an $h$-index variant, and as such is intended to complement rather than necessarily replace the $h$-index and other bibliometric indicators, thus providing a more complete picture of a researcher's achievements.",Digital Libraries

For this vision to become reality, however, authors must benefit from this process, so that they are incentivised to add these semantics. Moreover, the publication process that generates final content must allow and enable this semantic content. Here we focus on author-led or ""grey"" literature, which uses a convenient and simple publication pipeline. We describe how we have used metadata in articles to enable richer referencing of these articles and how we have customised the addition of these semantics to articles. Finally, we describe how we use the same semantics to aid in digital preservation and non-repudiability of research articles.",Digital Libraries
4108,"Coverage and adoption of altmetrics sources in the bibliometric
  community","Altmetrics, indices based on social media platforms and tools, have recently emerged as alternative means of measuring scholarly impact. Such indices assume that scholars in fact populate online social environments, and interact with scholarly products there. We tested this assumption by examining the use and coverage of social media environments amongst a sample of bibliometricians. As expected, coverage varied: 82% of articles published by sampled bibliometricians were included in Mendeley libraries, while only 28% were included in CiteULike. Mendeley bookmarking was moderately correlated (.45) with Scopus citation. Over half of respondents asserted that social media tools were affecting their professional lives, although uptake of online tools varied widely. 68% of those surveyed had LinkedIn accounts, while Academia.edu, Mendeley, and ResearchGate each claimed a fifth of respondents. Nearly half of those responding had Twitter accounts, which they used both personally and professionally. Surveyed bibliometricians had mixed opinions on altmetrics' potential; 72% valued download counts, while a third saw potential in tracking articles' influence in blogs, Wikipedia, reference managers, and social media. Altogether, these findings suggest that some online tools are seeing substantial use by bibliometricians, and that they present a potentially valuable source of impact data.",Digital Libraries

  international context: The case of the I-UGR Rankings of Spanish universities","The great importance international rankings have achieved in the research policy arena warns against many threats consequence of the flaws and shortcomings these tools present. One of them has to do with the inability to accurately represent national university systems as their original purpose is only to rank world-class universities. Another one has to do with the lack of representativeness of universities' disciplinary profiles as they usually provide a unique table. Although some rankings offer a great coverage and others offer league tables by fields, no international ranking does both. In order to surpass such limitation from a research policy viewpoint, this paper analyzes the possibility of using national rankings in order to complement international rankings. For this, we analyze the Spanish university system as a study case presenting the I-UGR Rankings for Spanish universities by fields and subfields. Then, we compare their results with those obtained by the Shanghai Ranking, the QS Ranking, the Leiden Ranking and the NTU Ranking, as they all have basic common grounds which allow such comparison. We conclude that it is advisable to use national rankings in order to complement international rankings, however we observe that this must be done with certain caution as they differ on the methodology employed as well as on the construction of the fields.",Digital Libraries

We analyze three possible factors which are considered to affect the citation impact of books: the presence of editors, the inclusion in series and the type of publisher. Also, we focus on highly cited books to see if these factors may affect them as well. We considered as highly cited books, those in the top 5% of the most highly cited ones of the database. We define these three aspects and we present the results for four major scientific areas in order to identify field-based differences (Science, Engineering & Technology, Social Sciences and Arts & Humanities). Finally we conclude observing that differences were noted for edited books and types of publishers. Although books included in series showed higher impact in two areas.",Digital Libraries
4114,"Most borrowed is most cited? Library loan statistics as a proxy for
  monograph selection in citation indexes","This study aims to analyse whether library loans statistics can be used as a measure of monograph use and as a selection criteria for inclusion in citation indexes. For this, we conducted an exploratory study based on loan data (1000 most borrowed monographs) from two non-Anglo-Saxon European university libraries (Granada and Vienna) with strong social sciences and humanities components. Loans to scientists only were also analysed at the University of Vienna. Furthermore, citation counts for the 100 most borrowed scientific monographs (SM) and textbooks or manuals (MTB) were retrieved from Web of Science and Google Scholar. The results show considerable similarities in both libraries: the percentage of loans for books in national languages represents almost 96 per cent of the total share and SM accounts only for 10 to 13 per cent. When considering loans to scientists only, the percentage of English books increases to 30 per cent, the percentage of SM loans also increases (approx 80 per cent). Furthermore, we found no significant correlations between loans and citations. Since loan statistics are currently insufficient for measuring the use of monographs, their suggested use as an applicable selection criterion for book citation indexes is not yet feasible. Data improvement and aggregation at different levels is a challenge for modern libraries in order to enable the exploitation of this invaluable information source for scientometric purposes.",Digital Libraries

Observing these traces can inform new metrics of scholarly influence and impact -- so-called ""altmetrics."" Stakeholders in academia are beginning to discuss how and where altmetrics can be useful towards evaluating a researcher's academic contribution. As this interest grows, libraries are in a unique position to help support an informed dialog on campus.

These factors give an advantage and make a clear evidence of innovative authors and reduce the known h-index for authors who are gaining citations by adding their names to multi-author papers. It is shown that various dimensions of ethical integrity and originality will be effective in this new index. An important scenario arising from the analysis is shown in terms of examples.

It shows that the proportion of WoS papers found on arXiv varies across the specialties of physics and mathematics, and that only a few specialties make extensive use of the repository. Elapsed time between arXiv submission and journal publication has shortened but remains longer in mathematics than in physics. In physics, mathematics, as well as in astronomy and astrophysics, arXiv versions are cited more promptly and decay faster than WoS papers.

Publication and citation data was downloaded from Scopus and matched with corresponding preprints in arXiv. Furthermore, the INSPIRE HEP database was used to retrieve citation data for papers related to HEP. The bibliometric analysis deals with the growth in numbers of articles published having a previous preprint in arXiv and the publication delay, which is defined as the chronological distance between the deposit of a preprint in arXiv and its formal journal publication. Likewise, the citation delay is analyzed, which describes the time it takes until the first citation of preprints, and articles, respectively. Total citation numbers are compared for sets of articles with a previous preprint and those without. The results show that in all fields but biology a significant citation advantage exists in terms of speed and citation rates for articles with a previous preprint version on arXiv.",Digital Libraries

  assessing over research proposals?","The peer review system has been traditionally challenged due to its many limitations especially for allocating funding. Bibliometric indicators may well present themselves as a complement. Objective: We analyze the relationship between peers' ratings and bibliometric indicators for Spanish researchers in the 2007 National R&D Plan for 23 research fields. We analyze peers' ratings for 2333 applications. We also gathered principal investigators' research output and impact and studied the differences between accepted and rejected applications. We used the Web of Science database and focused on the 2002-2006 period. First, we analyzed the distribution of granted and rejected proposals considering a given set of bibliometric indicators to test if there are significant differences. Then, we applied a multiple logistic regression analysis to determine if bibliometric indicators can explain by themselves the concession of grant proposals. 63.4% of the applications were funded. Bibliometric indicators for accepted proposals showed a better previous performance than for those rejected; however the correlation between peer review and bibliometric indicators is very heterogeneous among most areas. The logistic regression analysis showed that the main bibliometric indicators that explain the granting of research proposals in most cases are the output (number of published articles) and the number of papers published in journals that belong to the first quartile ranking of the Journal Citations Report. Bibliometric indicators predict the concession of grant proposals at least as well as peer ratings. Social Sciences and Education are the only areas where no relation was found, although this may be due to the limitations of the Web of Science's coverage. These findings encourage the use of bibliometric indicators as a complement to peer review in most of the analyzed areas.",Digital Libraries

4132,An Evaluation of Caching Policies for Memento TimeMaps,"As defined by the Memento Framework, TimeMaps are ma-chine-readable lists of time-specific copies -- called ""mementos"" -- of an archived original resource. In theory, as an archive acquires additional mementos over time, a TimeMap should be monotonically increasing. However, there are reasons why the number of mementos in a TimeMap would decrease, for example: archival redaction of some or all of the mementos, archival restructuring, and transient errors on the part of one or more archives. We study TimeMaps for 4,000 original resources over a three month period, note their change patterns, and develop a caching algorithm for TimeMaps suitable for a reverse proxy in front of a Memento aggregator. We show that TimeMap cardinality is constant or monotonically increasing for 80.2% of all TimeMap downloads observed in the observation period. The goal of the caching algorithm is to exploit the ideally monotonically increasing nature of TimeMaps and not cache responses with fewer mementos than the already cached TimeMap. This new caching algorithm uses conditional cache replacement and a Time To Live (TTL) value to ensure the user has access to the most complete TimeMap available. Based on our empirical data, a TTL of 15 days will minimize the number of mementos missed by users, and minimize the load on archives contributing to TimeMaps.",Digital Libraries

Each evaluation requires its own focus and methodology. To conduct a coherent research policy however, data on which different assessments are based should be well coordinated. A common set of core indicators for any type of research assessment can provide a supportive and objectivating tool for evaluations at different institutional levels and at the same time promote coherent decision-making. The same indicators can also form the basis for a 'light touch' monitoring instrument, signalling when and where a more thorough evaluation could be considered. This poster paper shows how peer review results were used to validate a set of quantitative indicators for research quality for a first series of disciplines. The indicators correspond to categories in the university's standard CV-format. Per discipline, specific indicators are identified corresponding to their own publication and funding characteristics. Also more globally valid indicators are identified after normalization for discipline-characteristic performance levels.

Excellence is also a comparative concept, implying the ability to surpass others [TIJSSEN, 2003]. Grants are in general awarded based on assessments by expert committees.

4136,"Quality related publication categories in social sciences and
  humanities, based on a university's peer review assessments","Bibliometric analysis has firmly conquered its place as an instrument for evaluation and international comparison of performance levels. Consequently, differences in coverage by standard bibliometric databases installed a dichotomy between on the one hand the well covered 'exact' sciences, and on the other hand most of the social sciences and humanities with a more limited coverage (Nederhof, 2006). Also the latter domains need to be able to soundly demonstrate their level of performance and claim or legitimate funding accordingly. An important part of the output volume in social sciences appears as books, book chapters and national literature (Hicks, 2004). To proceed from publication data to performance measurement, quantitative publication counts need to be combined with qualitative information, for example from peer assessment or validation (European Expert Group on Assessment of University-Based Research, 2010), to identify those categories that represent research quality as perceived by peers. An accurate focus is crucial in order to stimulate, recognize and reward high quality achievements only. This paper demonstrates how such a selection of publication categories can be based on correlations with peer judgments. It is also illustrated that the selection should be sufficiently precise, to avoid subcategories negatively correlated with peer judgments. The findings indicate that, also in social sciences and humanities, publications in journals with an international referee system are the most important category for evaluating quality.

  from a dedicated funding program","In a context of ever more specialized scientists, interdisciplinarity receives increasing attention as innovating ideas are often situated where the disciplines meet. In many countries science policy makers installed dedicated funding programs and policies. This induces a need for specific tools for their support. There is however not yet a generally accepted quantitative method or set of criteria to recognize and evaluate interdisciplinary research outputs (Tracking and evaluating interdisciplinary research: metrics and maps, 12th ISSI Conference, 2009). Interdisciplinarity also takes on very different forms, as distinguished in overviews from the first codifications (Klein, 1990) to the latest reference work (Frodeman et al., 2010). In the specific context of research measurement and evaluation, interdisciplinarity was discussed e.g. by Rinia (2007) and Porter et al. (2006). This empirical study aims to contribute to the understanding and the measuring of interdisciplinary research at the micro level, in the form of new synergies between disciplines. Investigation of a specialized funding program shows how a new interdisciplinary synergy and its citation impact are visible in co-publications and cocitations, and that these are important parameters for assessment.

This has led to specific policies aimed at interdisciplinary research in many countries. There is however at this moment no generally accepted method to adequately select and evaluate interdisciplinary research. In the vast context of different forms of interdisciplinarity, this paper aims to contribute to the debate on best practices to stimulate and support interdisciplinary research collaborations. It describes the selection procedures and results of a university program supporting networks formed 'bottom up', integrating expertise from different disciplines. The program's recent evaluation indicates that it is successful in selecting and supporting the interdisciplinary synergies aimed for, responding to a need experienced in the field.

The milestones are determined for two distinct groups of emerging market economies: the BRIC countries, which outperformed the relative growth expected at their identification in 2001, and the N-11 or Next Eleven countries, identified in 2005 as potential candidates for a BRIC-like evolution. Results show how these two groups at different economic levels can be clearly distinguished based on the research milestones, indicating a potential utility as parameters in an economic context.",Digital Libraries
4140,"Characteristics of International versus Non-International Scientific
  Publication Media in Team- and Author-Based Data","The enlarged coverage of the international publication and citation databases Web of Science and Scopus towards local media in social sciences was a welcome response to an increased usage of these databases in evaluation and funding systems. The mostly international journals available earlier were the basis for the development of current standard bibliometric indicators. The same indicators may no longer measure exactly the same concepts when applied to newly introduced or extended media categories, with possibly different characteristics than those of international journals. This paper investigates differences between media with and without international dimension in publication data at team and author level. The findings relate the international publication categories to research quality, important for validation of their usage in evaluation or funding models that aim to stimulate quality.",Digital Libraries
4141,"Groups of Highly Cited Publications: Stability in Content with Citation
  Window Length","The growing focus in research policy worldwide on top scientists makes it increasingly important to define adequate supporting measures to help identify excellent scientists. Highly cited publications have since long been associated to research excellence. At the same time, the analysis of the high-end of citation distributions still is a challenging topic in evaluative bibliometrics. Evaluations typically require indicators that generate sufficiently stable results when applied to recent publication records of limited size. Highly cited publications have been identified using two techniques in particular: pre-set percentiles, and the parameter free Characteristic Scores and Scales (CSS) (Gl\""anzel & Schubert, 1988). The stability required in assessments of relatively small publication records, concerns size as well as content of groups of highly cited publications. Influencing factors include domain delineation and citation window length. Stability in size is evident for the pre-set percentiles, and has been demonstrated for the CSS-methodology beyond an initial citation period of about three years (Gl\""anzel, 2007). Stability in content is less straightforward, considering for instance that more highly cited publications can have a later citation peak, as observed by Abt (1981) for astronomical papers. This paper investigates the stability in content of groups of highly cited publications, i.e. the extent to which individual publications enter and leave the group as the citation window is enlarged.",Digital Libraries
4142,"Partition-based Field Normalization: An approach to highly specialized
  publication records","Field normalized citation rates are well-established indicators for research performance from the broadest aggregation levels such as countries, down to institutes and research teams. When applied to still more specialized publication sets at the level of individual scientists, also a more accurate delimitation is required of the reference domain that provides the expectations to which a performance is compared. This necessity for sharper accuracy challenges standard methodology based on predefined subject categories. This paper proposes a way to define a reference domain that is more strongly delimited than in standard methodology, by building it up out of cells of the partition created by the pre-defined subject categories and their intersections. This partition approach can be applied to different existing field normalization variants. The resulting reference domain lies between those generated by standard field normalization and journal normalization. Examples based on fictive and real publication records illustrate how the potential impact on results can exceed or be smaller than the effect of other currently debated normalization variants, depending on the case studied. The proposed Partition-based Field Normalization is expected to offer advantages in particular at the level of individual scientists and other very specific publication records, such as publication output from interdisciplinary research.",Digital Libraries

4144,Reliability and Comparability of Peer Review Results,"In this paper peer review reliability is investigated based on peer ratings of research teams at two Belgian universities. It is found that outcomes can be substantially influenced by the different ways in which experts attribute ratings. To increase reliability of peer ratings, procedures creating a uniform reference level should be envisaged. One should at least check for signs of low reliability, which can be obtained from an analysis of the outcomes of the peer evaluation itself. The peer review results are compared to outcomes from a citation analysis of publications by the same teams, in subject fields well covered by citation indexes. It is illustrated how, besides reliability, comparability of results depends on the nature of the indicators, on the subject area and on the intrinsic characteristics of the methods. The results further confirm what is currently considered as good practice: the presentation of results for not one but for a series of indicators.",Digital Libraries
4145,"Research evaluation per discipline: a peer-review method and its
  outcomes","This paper describes the method for ex-post peer review evaluation per research discipline used at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (VUB) and summarizes the outcomes obtained from it. The method produces pertinent advice and triggers responses - at the level of the individual researcher, the research team and the university's research management - for the benefit of research quality, competitivity and visibility. Imposed reflection and contacts during and after the evaluation procedure modify the individual researcher's attitude, improve the research teams' strategies and allow for the extraction of general recommendations that are used as discipline-dependent guidelines in the university's research management. The deep insights gained in the different research disciplines and the substantial data sets on their research, support the university management in its policy decisions and in building policy instruments. Moreover, the results are used as a basis for comparison with other assessments, leading to a better understanding of the possibilities and limitations of different evaluation processes. The peer review method can be applied systematically in a pluri-annual cycle of research discipline evaluations to build up a complete overview, or it can be activated on an ad hoc basis for a particular discipline, based on demands from research teams or on strategic or policy arguments.",Digital Libraries

  excellent scientists","This paper contributes to the quest for an operational definition of 'research excellence' and proposes a translation of the excellence concept into a bibliometric indicator. Starting from a textual analysis of funding program calls aimed at individual researchers and from the challenges for an indicator at this level in particular, a new type of indicator is proposed. The Impact Vitality indicator [RONS & AMEZ, 2008] reflects the vitality of the impact of a researcher's publication output, based on the change in volume over time of the citing publications. The introduced metric is shown to posses attractive operational characteristics and meets a number of criteria which are desirable when comparing individual researchers. The validity of one of the possible indicator variants is tested using a small dataset of applicants for a senior full time Research Fellowship. Options for further research involve testing various indicator variants on larger samples linked to different kinds of evaluations.",Digital Libraries
4147,On the Change in Archivability of Websites Over Time,"As web technologies evolve, web archivists work to keep up so that our digital history is preserved. Recent advances in web technologies have introduced client-side executed scripts that load data without a referential identifier or that require user interaction (e.g., content loading when the page has scrolled). These advances have made automating methods for capturing web pages more difficult. Because of the evolving schemes of publishing web pages along with the progressive capability of web preservation tools, the archivability of pages on the web has varied over time. In this paper we show that the archivability of a web page can be deduced from the type of page being archived, which aligns with that page's accessibility in respect to dynamic content. We show concrete examples of when these technologies were introduced by referencing mementos of pages that have persisted through a long evolution of available technologies. Identifying these reasons for the inability of these web pages to be archived in the past in respect to accessibility serves as a guide for ensuring that content that has longevity is published using good practice methods that make it available for preservation.",Digital Libraries

  publication year spectroscopy (RPYS)","We introduce the quantitative method named ""reference publication year spectroscopy"" (RPYS). With this method one can determine the historical roots of research fields and quantify their impact on current research. RPYS is based on the analysis of the frequency with which references are cited in the publications of a specific research field in terms of the publication years of these cited references. The origins show up in the form of more or less pronounced peaks mostly caused by individual publications which are cited particularly frequently. In this study, we use research on graphene and on solar cells to illustrate how RPYS functions, and what results it can deliver.",Digital Libraries
4149,"Accuracy of simple, initials-based methods for author name
  disambiguation","There are a number of solutions that perform unsupervised name disambiguation based on the similarity of bibliographic records or common co-authorship patterns. Whether the use of these advanced methods, which are often difficult to implement, is warranted depends on whether the accuracy of the most basic disambiguation methods, which only use the author's last name and initials, is sufficient for a particular purpose. We derive realistic estimates for the accuracy of simple, initials-based methods using simulated bibliographic datasets in which the true identities of authors are known. Based on the simulations in five diverse disciplines we find that the first initial method already correctly identifies 97% of authors. An alternative simple method, which takes all initials into account, is typically two times less accurate, except in certain datasets that can be identified by applying a simple criterion. Finally, we introduce a new name-based method that combines the features of first initial and all initials methods by implicitly taking into account the last name frequency and the size of the dataset. This hybrid method reduces the fraction of incorrectly identified authors by 10-30% over the first initial method.",Digital Libraries
4150,"Tweeting biomedicine: an analysis of tweets and citations in the
  biomedical literature","Data collected by social media platforms have recently been introduced as a new source for indicators to help measure the impact of scholarly research in ways that are complementary to traditional citation-based indicators. Data generated from social media activities related to scholarly content can be used to reflect broad types of impact. This paper aims to provide systematic evidence regarding how often Twitter is used to diffuse journal articles in the biomedical and life sciences. The analysis is based on a set of 1.4 million documents covered by both PubMed and Web of Science (WoS) and published between 2010 and 2012. The number of tweets containing links to these documents was analyzed to evaluate the degree to which certain journals, disciplines, and specialties were represented on Twitter. It is shown that, with less than 10% of PubMed articles mentioned on Twitter, its uptake is low in general. The relationship between tweets and WoS citations was examined for each document at the level of journals and specialties. The results show that tweeting behavior varies between journals and specialties and correlations between tweets and citations are low, implying that impact metrics based on tweets are different from those based on citations. A framework utilizing the coverage of articles and the correlation between Twitter mentions and citations is proposed to facilitate the evaluation of novel social-media based metrics and to shed light on the question in how far the number of tweets is a valid metric to measure research impact.",Digital Libraries

This directory would extend the traditional city directory by including a wider range of entities being described, much richer information about the entities mentioned and linkages to mentions of the entities in material such as digitized historical newspapers. Such a directory would be useful to readers who browse the historical newspapers by providing structured summaries of the entities mentioned. We describe the occurrence of entities in two years of the Norfolk Weekly News, focusing on several individuals to better understand the types of information which can be gleaned from historical newspapers and other historical materials. We also describe a prototype program which coordinates information about entities from the traditional city directories, the federal census, and from newspapers. We discuss the structured coding for these entities, noting that richer coding would increasingly include descriptions of events and scenarios. We propose that rich content about individuals and communities could eventually be modeled with agents and woven into historical narratives.",Digital Libraries
4152,Categorizing Influential Authors Using Penalty Areas,"The concept of h-index has been proposed to easily assess a researcher's performance with a single two-dimensional number. However, by using only this single number, we lose significant information about the distribution of the number of citations per article of an author's publication list. Two authors with the same h-index may have totally different distributions of the number of citations per article. One may have a very long ""tail"" in the citation curve, i.e. he may have published a great number of articles, which did not receive relatively many citations. Another researcher may have a short tail, i.e. almost all his publications got a relatively large number of citations. In this article, we study an author's citation curve and we define some areas appearing in this curve. These areas are used to further evaluate authors' research performance from quantitative and qualitative point of view. We call these areas as ""penalty"" ones, since the greater they are, the more an author's performance is penalized. Moreover, we use these areas to establish new metrics aiming at categorizing researchers in two distinct categories: ""influential"" ones vs. ""mass producers"".",Digital Libraries

  bibliometric indicators","Google Scholar has been well received by the research community. Its promises of free, universal and easy access to scientific literature as well as the perception that it covers better than other traditional multidisciplinary databases the areas of the Social Sciences and the Humanities have contributed to the quick expansion of Google Scholar Citations and Google Scholar Metrics: two new bibliometric products that offer citation data at the individual level and at journal level. In this paper we show the results of a experiment undertaken to analyze Google Scholar's capacity to detect citation counting manipulation. For this, six documents were uploaded to an institutional web domain authored by a false researcher and referencing all the publications of the members of the EC3 research group at the University of Granada. The detection of Google Scholar of these papers outburst the citations included in the Google Scholar Citations profiles of the authors. We discuss the effects of such outburst and how it could affect the future development of such products not only at individual level but also at journal level, especially if Google Scholar persists with its lack of transparency.",Digital Libraries
4156,Just Google It - Digital Research Practices of Humanities Scholars,"The transition from analogue to digital archives and the recent explosion of online content offers researchers novel ways of engaging with data. The crucial question for ensuring a balance between the supply and demand-side of data, is whether this trend connects to existing scholarly practices and to the average search skills of researchers. To gain insight into this process we conducted a survey among nearly three hundred (N= 288) humanities scholars in the Netherlands and Belgium with the aim of finding answers to the following questions: 1) To what extent are digital databases and archives used? 2) What are the preferences in search functionalities 3) Are there differences in search strategies between novices and experts of information retrieval? Our results show that while scholars actively engage in research online they mainly search for text and images. General search systems such as Google and JSTOR are predominant, while large-scale collections such as Europeana are rarely consulted. Searching with keywords is the dominant search strategy and advanced search options are rarely used. When comparing novice and more experienced searchers, the first tend to have a more narrow selection of search engines, and mostly use keywords. Our overall findings indicate that Google is the key player among available search engines. This dominant use illustrates the paradoxical attitude of scholars toward Google: while provenance and context are deemed key academic requirements, the workings of the Google algorithm remain unclear. We conclude that Google introduces a black box into digital scholarly practices, indicating scholars will become increasingly dependent on such black boxed algorithms. This calls for a reconsideration of the academic principles of provenance and context.",Digital Libraries

Entitymetrics highlight the importance of entities embedded in scientific literature for further knowledge discovery. In this paper, we use Metformin, a drug for diabetes, as an example to form an entity-entity citation network based on literature related to Metformin. We then calculate the network features and compare the centrality ranks of biological entities with results from Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD). The comparison demonstrates the usefulness of entitymetrics to detect most of the outstanding interactions manually curated in CTD.",Digital Libraries
4158,Finding knowledge paths among scientific disciplines,"This paper discovers patterns of knowledge dissemination among scientific disciplines. While the transfer of knowledge is largely unobservable, citations from one discipline to another have been proven to be an effective proxy to study disciplinary knowledge flow. This study constructs a knowledge flow network in that a node represents a Journal Citation Report subject category and a link denotes the citations from one subject category to another. Using the concept of shortest path, several quantitative measurements are proposed and applied to a knowledge flow network. Based on an examination of subject categories in Journal Citation Report, this paper finds that social science domains tend to be more self-contained and thus it is more difficult for knowledge from other domains to flow into them; at the same time, knowledge from science domains, such as biomedicine-, chemistry-, and physics-related domains can access and be accessed by other domains more easily. This paper also finds that social science domains are more disunified than science domains, as three fifths of the knowledge paths from one social science domain to another need at least one science domain to serve as an intermediate.

We profile twelve public web archives using data from a variety of sources (the web, archives' access logs, and full-text queries to archives) and discover that only sending queries to the top three web archives (i.e., a 75% reduction in the number of queries) for any request produces the full TimeMaps on 84% of the cases.",Digital Libraries

We find that users request English pages the most, followed by the European languages. Most human users come to web archives because they do not find the requested pages on the live web. About 65% of the requested archived pages no longer exist on the live web. We find that more than 82% of human sessions connect to the Wayback Machine via referrals from other web sites, while only 15% of robots have referrers.

  Hand-held Media","Many memory institutions hold large collections of hand-held media, which can comprise hundreds of terabytes of data spread over many thousands of data-carriers. Many of these carriers are at risk of significant physical degradation over time, depending on their composition. Unfortunately, handling them manually is enormously time consuming and so a full and frequent evaluation of their condition is extremely expensive. It is, therefore, important to develop scalable processes for stabilizing them onto backed-up online storage where they can be subject to highquality digital preservation management. This goes hand in hand with the need to establish efficient, standardized ways of recording metadata and to deal with defective data-carriers. This paper discusses processing approaches, workflows, technical set-up, software solutions and touches on staffing needs for the stabilization process. We have experimented with different disk copying robots, defined our metadata, and addressed storage issues to scale stabilization to the vast quantities of digital objects on hand-held data-carriers that need to be preserved. Working closely with the content curators, we have been able to build a robust data migration workflow and have stabilized over 16 terabytes of data in a scalable and economical manner.",Digital Libraries

  Drift in Acyclic Walks Through a Web Archive","When a user views an archived page using the archive's user interface (UI), the user selects a datetime to view from a list. The archived web page, if available, is then displayed. From this display, the web archive UI attempts to simulate the web browsing experience by smoothly transitioning between archived pages. During this process, the target datetime changes with each link followed; drifting away from the datetime originally selected. When browsing sparsely-archived pages, this nearly-silent drift can be many years in just a few clicks. We conducted 200,000 acyclic walks of archived pages, following up to 50 links per walk, comparing the results of two target datetime policies. The Sliding Target policy allows the target datetime to change as it does in archive UIs such as the Internet Archive's Wayback Machine. The Sticky Target policy, represented by the Memento API, keeps the target datetime the same throughout the walk. We found that the Sliding Target policy drift increases with the number of walk steps, number of domains visited, and choice (number of links available). However, the Sticky Target policy controls temporal drift, holding it to less than 30 days on average regardless of walk length or number of domains visited. The Sticky Target policy shows some increase as choice increases, but this may be caused by other factors. We conclude that based on walk length, the Sticky Target policy generally produces at least 30 days less drift than the Sliding Target policy.",Digital Libraries
4164,On the Internal Dynamics of the Shanghai Ranking,"The Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) published by researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University has become a major source of information for university administrators, country officials, students and the public at large. Recent discoveries regarding its internal dynamics allow the inversion of published ARWU indicator scores to reconstruct raw scores for five hundred world class universities. This paper explores raw scores in the ARWU and in other contests to contrast the dynamics of rank-driven and score-driven tables, and to explain why the ARWU ranking is a score-driven procedure. We show that the ARWU indicators constitute sub-scales of a single factor accounting for research performance, and provide an account of the system of gains and non-linearities used by ARWU. The paper discusses the non-linearities selected by ARWU, concluding that they are designed to represent the regressive character of indicators measuring research performance.

  relationship with economic indicators","The main goal of this research is to analyze the web structure and performance of units and services belonging to U.S. academic libraries in order to check their suitability for webometric studies. Our objectives include studying their possible correlation with economic data and assessing their use for complementary evaluation purposes. We conducted a survey of library homepages, institutional repositories, digital collections, and online catalogs (a total of 374 URLs) belonging to the 100 U.S. universities with the highest total expenditures in academic libraries according to data provided by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). Several data points were taken and analyzed, including web variables (page count, external links, and visits) and economic variables (total expenditures, expenditures on printed and electronic books, and physical visits). The results indicate that the variety of URL syntaxes is wide, diverse and complex, which produces a misrepresentation of academic library web resources and reduces the accuracy of web analysis. On the other hand, institutional and web data indicators are not highly correlated. Better results are obtained by correlating total library expenditures with URL mentions measured by Google (r= 0.546) and visits measured by Compete (r= 0.573), respectively. Because correlation values obtained are not highly significant, we estimate such correlations will increase if users can avoid linkage problems (due to the complexity of URLs) and gain direct access to log files (for more accurate data about visits).",Digital Libraries

  method of quantitative analysis of a university system: the case of Spain","The aggregation of web performance (page count and visibility) of internal university units could constitute a more precise indicator than the overall web performance of the universities and, therefore, be of use in the design of university web rankings. In order to test this hypothesis, a longitudinal analysis of the internal units of the Spanish university system was conducted over the course of 2010. For the 13800 URLs identified, page count and visibility was calculated using the Yahoo API. The internal values obtained were aggregated by university and compared with the values obtained from the analysis of the university general URLs. The results indicate that, although the correlations between general and internal values are high, internal performance is low in comparison to general performance, and that they give rise to different performance rankings. The conclusion is that the aggregation of unit performance is of limited use due to the low levels of internal development of the websites, and so its use is not recommended for the design of rankings. Despite this, the internal analysis enabled the detection of, amongst other things, a low correlation between page count and visibility due to the widespread use of subdirectories and problems accessing certain content.",Digital Libraries
4173,Proposal for a multilevel university cybermetric analysis model,"University online seats have gradually become complex systems of dynamic information where all their institutions and services are linked and potentially accessible.

However, previous research into web subunits shows that it is possible to carry out systemic web analyses, which open up the possibility of carrying out studies which address university diversity, necessary for both describing the university in greater detail and for establishing comparable ranking units. To address this issue, a multilevel university cybermetric analysis model is proposed, based on parts (core and satellite), levels (institutional and external) and sublevels (contour and internal), providing a deeper analysis of institutions. Finally the model is integrated into another which is independent of the technique used, and applied by analysing Harvard University as an example of use.",Digital Libraries

We indicate that the construction of research profiles may be a good solution for universities for finding out levels of discrepancy between organizational units and subject fields.",Digital Libraries
4175,Google Scholar Metrics evolution: an analysis according to languages,"In November 2012 the Google Scholar Metrics (GSM) journal rankings were updated, making it possible to compare bibliometric indicators in the 10 languages indexed and their stability with the April 2012 version. The h-index and h 5 median of 1000 journals were analysed, comparing their averages, maximum and minimum values and the correlation coefficient within rankings. The bibliometric figures grew significantly. In just seven and a half months the h index of the journals increased by 15% and the median h-index by 17%. This growth was observed for all the bibliometric indicators analysed and for practically every journal. However, we found significant differences in growth rates depending on the language in which the journal is published. Moreover, the journal rankings seem to be stable between April and November, reinforcing the credibility of the data held by Google Scholar and the reliability of the GSM journal rankings, despite the uncontrolled growth of Google Scholar. Based on the findings of this study we suggest, firstly, that Google should upgrade its rankings at least semiannually and, secondly, that the results should be displayed in each ranking proportionally to the number of journals indexed by language",Digital Libraries

Google Scholar Metrics doesnt currently allow to group and sort all journals belonging to a scientific discipline. In the case of Communication, in the ten listings displayed by GSM we can only locate 46 journals.

  indexed in the 'Book Citation Index'","Purpose: The aim of this study is to analyze the disciplinary coverage of the Thomson Reuters' Book Citation Index database focusing on publisher presence, impact and specialization. Design/Methodology/approach: We conduct a descriptive study in which we examine coverage by discipline, publisher distribution by field and country of publication, and publisher impact. For this the Thomson Reuters' Subject Categories were aggregated into 15 disciplines. Findings: 30% of the total share of this database belongs to the fields of Humanities and Social Sciences. Most of the disciplines are covered by very few publishers mainly from the UK and USA (75.05% of the books), in fact 33 publishers concentrate 90% of the whole share. Regarding publisher impact, 80.5% of the books and chapters remained uncited. Two serious errors were found in this database. Firstly, the Book Citation Index does not retrieve all citations for books and chapters. Secondly, book citations do not include citations to their chapters. Research limitations/implications: The Book Citation Index is still underdeveloped and has serious limitations which call into caution when using it for bibliometric purposes. Practical implications: The results obtained from this study warn against the use of this database for bibliometric purposes, but opens a new window of opportunities for covering long neglected areas such as Humanities and Social Sciences. The target audience of this study is librarians, bibliometricians, researchers, scientific publishers, prospective authors and evaluation agencies.

The dramatic increase of the scientific documents in the last few years makes it necessary that the retrieved information by the search engines be analyzed and more organized and interpretable representation be displayed to the users. Information visualization is a great way for exploration of large and complex data sets, therefore it can be a natural candidate for the purpose of generating more comprehensible search results for the citation and academic databases.

  Data and Methods on the Open Web","Research in life sciences is increasingly being conducted in a digital and online environment. In particular, life scientists have been pioneers in embracing new computational tools to conduct their investigations. To support the sharing of digital objects produced during such research investigations, we have witnessed in the last few years the emergence of specialized repositories, e.g., DataVerse and FigShare. Such repositories provide users with the means to share and publish datasets that were used or generated in research investigations. While these repositories have proven their usefulness, interpreting and reusing evidence for most research results is a challenging task. Additional contextual descriptions are needed to understand how those results were generated and/or the circumstances under which they were concluded. Because of this, scientists are calling for models that go beyond the publication of datasets to systematically capture the life cycle of scientific investigations and provide a single entry point to access the information about the hypothesis investigated, the datasets used, the experiments carried out, the results of the experiments, the people involved in the research, etc. In this paper we present the Research Object (RO) suite of ontologies, which provide a structured container to encapsulate research data and methods along with essential metadata descriptions. Research Objects are portable units that enable the sharing, preservation, interpretation and reuse of research investigation results. The ontologies we present have been designed in the light of requirements that we gathered from life scientists. They have been built upon existing popular vocabularies to facilitate interoperability. Furthermore, we have developed tools to support the creation and sharing of Research Objects, thereby promoting and facilitating their adoption.",Digital Libraries

  altmetric indicators with citations from a multidisciplinary perspective","An extensive analysis of the presence of different altmetric indicators provided by Altmetric.com across scientific fields is presented, particularly focusing on their relationship with citations. Our results confirm that the presence and density of social media altmetric counts are still very low and not very frequent among scientific publications, with 15%-24% of the publications presenting some altmetric activity and concentrating in the most recent publications, although their presence is increasing over time. Publications from the social sciences, humanities and the medical and life sciences show the highest presence of altmetrics, indicating their potential value and interest for these fields. The analysis of the relationships between altmetrics and citations confirms previous claims of positive correlations but relatively weak, thus supporting the idea that altmetrics do not reflect the same concept of impact as citations. Also, altmetric counts do not always present a better filtering of highly cited publications than journal citation scores. Altmetrics scores (particularly mentions in blogs) are able to identify highly cited publications with higher levels of precision than journal citation scores (JCS), but they have a lower level of recall. The value of altmetrics as a complementary tool of citation analysis is highlighted, although more research is suggested to disentangle the potential meaning and value of altmetric indicators for research evaluation.",Digital Libraries

The present quantitative analysis of the literature has been carried out in order to acquire an overview of these methods and an indication of an ""average"" or ""most frequent"" bibliometric practice. The search in the Web of Science yielded 321 papers dealing with ""highly cited"", ""most cited"", ""top cited"" and ""most frequently cited"". Of the 321 papers, 16 could not be used in this study. In around 80% of the papers analyzed in this study, a quantitative definition has been provided with which to identify excellent papers. With definitions which relate to an absolute number, either a certain number of top cited papers (58%) or papers with a minimum number of citations are selected (17%). Around 23% worked with percentile rank classes. Over these papers, there is an arithmetic average of the top 7.6% (arithmetic average) or of the top 3% (median). The top 1% is used most frequently in the papers, followed by the top 10%.

Comparing the EU28, USA, and China at the global level shows a top-level dynamics that is different from the analysis in terms of shares of publications: the United States remains far more productive in the top-1% of all papers; China drops out of the competition for elite status; and the EU28 increased its share among the top-cited papers from 2000-2010. Some of the EU28 member states overtook the U.S. during this decade, but a clear divide remains between EU15 (Western Europe) and the Accession Countries.

First, global maps were developed for the two sets separately; sets of documents can then be compared using overlays to both maps. Using fuzzy-string matching and ISSN numbers, we were able to match 10,524 journal names between the two sets; that is, 96.4% of the 10,936 journals contained in JCR or 51.2% of the 20,554 journals covered by Scopus. Network analysis was then pursued on the set of journals shared between the two databases and the two sets of unique journals. Citations among the shared journals are more comprehensively covered in JCR than Scopus, so the network in JCR is denser and more connected than in Scopus. The ranking of shared journals in terms of indegree (that is, numbers of citing journals) or total citations is similar in both databases overall (Spearman's \r{ho} > 0.97), but some individual journals rank very differently. Journals that are unique to Scopus seem to be less important--they are citing shared journals rather than being cited by them--but the humanities are covered better in Scopus than in JCR.",Digital Libraries
4191,"The substantive and practical significance of citation impact
  differences between institutions: Guidelines for the analysis of percentiles
  using effect sizes and confidence intervals","In our chapter we address the statistical analysis of percentiles: How should the citation impact of institutions be compared? In educational and psychological testing, percentiles are already used widely as a standard to evaluate an individual's test scores - intelligence tests for example - by comparing them with the percentiles of a calibrated sample. Percentiles, or percentile rank classes, are also a very suitable method for bibliometrics to normalize citations of publications in terms of the subject category and the publication year and, unlike the mean-based indicators (the relative citation rates), percentiles are scarcely affected by skewed distributions of citations. The percentile of a certain publication provides information about the citation impact this publication has achieved in comparison to other similar publications in the same subject category and publication year. Analyses of percentiles, however, have not always been presented in the most effective and meaningful way. New APA guidelines (American Psychological Association, 2010) suggest a lesser emphasis on significance tests and a greater emphasis on the substantive and practical significance of findings. Drawing on work by Cumming (2012) we show how examinations of effect sizes (e.g. Cohen's d statistic) and confidence intervals can lead to a clear understanding of citation impact differences.",Digital Libraries

To assess the extent to which these countries have become important players on the top level, we compare the BRICS countries with the top-performing countries worldwide. As the analyses of the (annual) growth rates show, with the exception of Russia, the BRICS countries have increased their output in terms of most frequently-cited papers at a higher rate than the top-cited countries worldwide. In a further step of analysis for this study, we generate co-authorship networks among authors of highly cited papers for four time points to view changes in BRICS participation (1995, 2000, 2005, and 2010).

The results showed that the CDOI does contain significant capacity to predict outcome delta over time based on baseline and early change scores in a large, real-world clinical setting, as suggested in previous research. The implementation analysis revealed a number of critical factors affecting successful implementation and adoption of the CDOI outcome measure, though there was a notable disconnect between clinician intentions and actual behavior.

There has been a tremendous success in applying them for narrow intellectual tasks such as pattern recognition, natural language processing and playing Go. The latter application vastly outperforms the strongest human player in recent years. However, these tasks are formalized by people in such ways that it has become ""easy"" for automated recipes to find better solutions than humans do. In the sense of John Searle's Chinese Room Argument, the computer playing Go does not actually understand anything from the game. Thinking like a human mind requires to go beyond the curve fitting paradigm of current systems. There is a fundamental limit to what they can achieve currently as only very specific problem formalization can increase their performances in particular tasks. In this paper, we argue than one of the most important aspects of the human mind is its capacity for logical thinking, which gives rise to many intellectual expressions that differentiate us from animal brains.

5742,SIND: A Drone Dataset at Signalized Intersection in China,"Intersection is one of the most challenging scenarios for autonomous driving tasks. Due to the complexity and stochasticity, essential applications (e.g., behavior modeling, motion prediction, safety validation, etc.) at intersections rely heavily on data-driven techniques. Thus, there is an intense demand for trajectory datasets of traffic participants (TPs) in intersections. Currently, most intersections in urban areas are equipped with traffic lights. However, there is not yet a large-scale, high-quality, publicly available trajectory dataset for signalized intersections. Therefore, in this paper, a typical two-phase signalized intersection is selected in Tianjin, China. Besides, a pipeline is designed to construct a Signalized INtersection Dataset (SIND), which contains 7 hours of recording including over 13,000 TPs with 7 types. Then, the behaviors of traffic light violations in SIND are recorded. Furthermore, the SIND is also compared with other similar works. The features of the SIND can be summarized as follows: 1) SIND provides more comprehensive information, including traffic light states, motion parameters, High Definition (HD) map, etc. 2) The category of TPs is diverse and characteristic, where the proportion of vulnerable road users (VRUs) is up to 62.6% 3) Multiple traffic light violations of non-motor vehicles are shown.

In this work, we discuss and analyse the challenges and opportunities we faced throughout the creation of a transnational, European agricultural dataset containing reference labels of cultivated crops. Together, this forms a succinct framework of important elements one should consider when forging a dataset of their own.",Digital Libraries

5757,A Reflection on the Structure and Process of the Web of Data,"The Web community has introduced a set of standards and technologies for representing, querying, and manipulating a globally distributed data structure known as the Web of Data. The proponents of the Web of Data envision much of the world's data being interrelated and openly accessible to the general public. This vision is analogous in many ways to the Web of Documents of common knowledge, but instead of making documents and media openly accessible, the focus is on making data openly accessible. In providing data for public use, there has been a stimulated interest in a movement dubbed Open Data. Open Data is analogous in many ways to the Open Source movement. However, instead of focusing on software, Open Data is focused on the legal and licensing issues around publicly exposed data. Together, various technological and legal tools are laying the groundwork for the future of global-scale data management on the Web. As of today, in its early form, the Web of Data hosts a variety of data sets that include encyclopedic facts, drug and protein data, metadata on music, books and scholarly articles, social network representations, geospatial information, and many other types of information. The size and diversity of the Web of Data is a demonstration of the flexibility of the underlying standards and the overall feasibility of the project as a whole. The purpose of this article is to provide a review of the technological underpinnings of the Web of Data as well as some of the hurdles that need to be overcome if the Web of Data is to emerge as the defacto medium for data representation, distribution, and ultimately, processing.",Artificial Intelligence

In this area a particular interest has the study of community structures. The analysis of this type of structure requires the formalization of the intuitive concept of community and the definition of indices of goodness for the obtained results. A lot of algorithms has been presented to reach this goal. In particular, an interesting problem is the search of overlapped communities and it is field seems very interesting a solution based on the use of genetic algorithms. The approach discusses in this paper is based on a parallel implementation of a genetic algorithm and shows the performance benefits of this solution.",Information Retrieval

In this article we provide practical case studies and links to resources for use by AI educators. We also provide concrete suggestions on how to integrate AI ethics into a general artificial intelligence course and how to teach a stand-alone artificial intelligence ethics course.",Artificial Intelligence

5774,Knowledge Scientists: Unlocking the data-driven organization,"Organizations across all sectors are increasingly undergoing deep transformation and restructuring towards data-driven operations. The central role of data highlights the need for reliable and clean data. Unreliable, erroneous, and incomplete data lead to critical bottlenecks in processing pipelines and, ultimately, service failures, which are disastrous for the competitive performance of the organization. Given its central importance, those organizations which recognize and react to the need for reliable data will have the advantage in the coming decade. We argue that the technologies for reliable data are driven by distinct concerns and expertise which complement those of the data scientist and the data engineer. Those organizations which identify the central importance of meaningful, explainable, reproducible, and maintainable data will be at the forefront of the democratization of reliable data. We call the new role which must be developed to fill this critical need the Knowledge Scientist. The organizational structures, tools, methodologies and techniques to support and make possible the work of knowledge scientists are still in their infancy. As organizations not only use data but increasingly rely on data, it is time to empower the people who are central to this transformation.",Databases
5781,"Towards the Classification of Error-Related Potentials using Riemannian
  Geometry","The error-related potential (ErrP) is an event-related potential (ERP) evoked by an experimental participant's recognition of an error during task performance. ErrPs, originally described by cognitive psychologists, have been adopted for use in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for the detection and correction of errors, and the online refinement of decoding algorithms. Riemannian geometry-based feature extraction and classification is a new approach to BCI which shows good performance in a range of experimental paradigms, but has yet to be applied to the classification of ErrPs. Here, we describe an experiment that elicited ErrPs in seven normal participants performing a visual discrimination task. Audio feedback was provided on each trial. We used multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings to classify ErrPs (success/failure), comparing a Riemannian geometry-based method to a traditional approach that computes time-point features. Overall, the Riemannian approach outperformed the traditional approach (78.2% versus 75.9% accuracy, p < 0.05); this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05) in three of seven participants. These results indicate that the Riemannian approach better captured the features from feedback-elicited ErrPs, and may have application in BCI for error detection and correction.",Machine Learning
5782,A Taxonomy of Anomalies in Log Data,"Log data anomaly detection is a core component in the area of artificial intelligence for IT operations. However, the large amount of existing methods makes it hard to choose the right approach for a specific system. A better understanding of different kinds of anomalies, and which algorithms are suitable for detecting them, would support researchers and IT operators. Although a common taxonomy for anomalies already exists, it has not yet been applied specifically to log data, pointing out the characteristics and peculiarities in this domain.   In this paper, we present a taxonomy for different kinds of log data anomalies and introduce a method for analyzing such anomalies in labeled datasets. We applied our taxonomy to the three common benchmark datasets Thunderbird, Spirit, and BGL, and trained five state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms to evaluate their performance in detecting different kinds of anomalies. Our results show, that the most common anomaly type is also the easiest to predict. Moreover, deep learning-based approaches outperform data mining-based approaches in all anomaly types, but especially when it comes to detecting contextual anomalies.",Databases

In this article we present new empirical data from a survey to 237 data science professionals on the use of project management methodologies for data science. We provide additional profiling of the survey respondents' roles and their priorities when executing data science projects. Based on this survey study, the main findings are: (1) Agile data science lifecycle is the most widely used framework, but only 25% of the survey participants state to follow a data science project methodology. (2) The most important success factors are precisely describing stakeholders' needs, communicating the results to end-users, and team collaboration and coordination.

5787,"The Carbon Footprint of Machine Learning Training Will Plateau, Then
  Shrink","Machine Learning (ML) workloads have rapidly grown in importance, but raised concerns about their carbon footprint. Four best practices can reduce ML training energy by up to 100x and CO2 emissions up to 1000x. By following best practices, overall ML energy use (across research, development, and production) held steady at <15% of Google's total energy use for the past three years. If the whole ML field were to adopt best practices, total carbon emissions from training would reduce. Hence, we recommend that ML papers include emissions explicitly to foster competition on more than just model quality. Estimates of emissions in papers that omitted them have been off 100x-100,000x, so publishing emissions has the added benefit of ensuring accurate accounting. Given the importance of climate change, we must get the numbers right to make certain that we work on its biggest challenges.",Machine Learning

Machine learning provides an additional boost for this area.

In this paper we analyze machine learning for medical image analysis within the framework of Technology Readiness Levels and review how causal analysis methods can fill a gap when creating robust and adaptable medical image analysis algorithms. We review methods using causality in medical imaging AI/ML and find that causal analysis has the potential to mitigate critical problems for clinical translation but that uptake and clinical downstream research has been limited so far.",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition

  MARL","Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a useful approach to solving decentralised decision-making problems at scale. Research in the field has been growing steadily with many breakthrough algorithms proposed in recent years. In this work, we take a closer look at this rapid development with a focus on evaluation methodologies employed across a large body of research in cooperative MARL. By conducting a detailed meta-analysis of prior work, spanning 75 papers accepted for publication from 2016 to 2022, we bring to light worrying trends that put into question the true rate of progress. We further consider these trends in a wider context and take inspiration from single-agent RL literature on similar issues with recommendations that remain applicable to MARL. Combining these recommendations, with novel insights from our analysis, we propose a standardised performance evaluation protocol for cooperative MARL. We argue that such a standard protocol, if widely adopted, would greatly improve the validity and credibility of future research, make replication and reproducibility easier, as well as improve the ability of the field to accurately gauge the rate of progress over time by being able to make sound comparisons across different works. Finally, we release our meta-analysis data publicly on our project website for future research on evaluation: https://sites.google.com/view/marl-standard-protocol",Machine Learning

5801,Cards Against AI: Predicting Humor in a Fill-in-the-blank Party Game,"Humor is an inherently social phenomenon, with humorous utterances shaped by what is socially and culturally accepted. Understanding humor is an important NLP challenge, with many applications to human-computer interactions. In this work we explore humor in the context of Cards Against Humanity -- a party game where players complete fill-in-the-blank statements using cards that can be offensive or politically incorrect. We introduce a novel dataset of 300,000 online games of Cards Against Humanity, including 785K unique jokes, analyze it and provide insights. We trained machine learning models to predict the winning joke per game, achieving performance twice as good (20\%) as random, even without any user information. On the more difficult task of judging novel cards, we see the models' ability to generalize is moderate. Interestingly, we find that our models are primarily focused on punchline card, with the context having little impact. Analyzing feature importance, we observe that short, crude, juvenile punchlines tend to win.",Machine Learning

  Management","We discuss how distributed designs that draw from biological network metaphors can largely improve the current state of information retrieval and knowledge management of distributed information systems. In particular, two adaptive recommendation systems named TalkMine and @ApWeb are discussed in more detail. TalkMine operates at the semantic level of keywords. It leads different databases to learn new and adapt existing keywords to the categories recognized by its communities of users using distributed algorithms. @ApWeb operates at the structural level of information resources, namely citation or hyperlink structure. It relies on collective behavior to adapt such structure to the expectations of users. TalkMine and @ApWeb are currently being implemented for the research library of the Los Alamos National Laboratory under the Active Recommendation Project. Together they define a biologically motivated information retrieval system, recommending simultaneously at the level of user knowledge categories expressed in keywords, and at the level of individual documents and their associations to other documents. Rather than passive information retrieval, with this system, users obtain an active, evolving interaction with information resources.",Information Retrieval

The engineer must be aware of the use cases and the required application services and at a certain point of time he has to fix the data model which forms the base for the application services. However, once the data model has been fixed it is difficult to consider changing needs. This might be a problem in specific domains, which are as dynamic as the healthcare domain. With fuzzy data we address all those data that are difficult to organize in a single database. In this paper we discuss a gradual and pragmatic approach that uses the XML technology to conquer more model flexibility. XML may provide the clue between unstructured text data and structured database solutions and shift the paradigm from ""organizing the data along a given model"" towards ""organizing the data along user requirements"".",Information Retrieval

We present an approach for targeted spidering including metadata extraction and opportunistic crawling of specific semantic hyperlinks.

The BABAR Web site is, therefore, a community Web site. At the same time it is hosted at SLAC and funded by agencies that demand adherence to policies decided under different priorities. Additionally, the BABAR Web administrators deal with the problems that arise during the course of managing users, content, policies, standards, and changing technologies. Desired solutions to some of these problems may be incompatible with the overall administration of the SLAC Web sites and/or the SLAC policies and concerns. There are thus different perspectives of the same Web site and differing expectations in segments of the SLAC population which act as constraints and challenges in any review or re-engineering activities. Web Engineering, which post-dates the BABAR Web, has aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of Web development. This paper reports on the first part of a recent review of application of Web Engineering methods to the BABAR Web site, which has led to explicit user and information models of the BABAR community and how SLAC and the BABAR community relate and react to each other.

6868,"Shuffling a Stacked Deck: The Case for Partially Randomized Ranking of
  Search Engine Results","In-degree, PageRank, number of visits and other measures of Web page popularity significantly influence the ranking of search results by modern search engines. The assumption is that popularity is closely correlated with quality, a more elusive concept that is difficult to measure directly. Unfortunately, the correlation between popularity and quality is very weak for newly-created pages that have yet to receive many visits and/or in-links. Worse, since discovery of new content is largely done by querying search engines, and because users usually focus their attention on the top few results, newly-created but high-quality pages are effectively ``shut out,'' and it can take a very long time before they become popular.   We propose a simple and elegant solution to this problem: the introduction of a controlled amount of randomness into search result ranking methods. Doing so offers new pages a chance to prove their worth, although clearly using too much randomness will degrade result quality and annul any benefits achieved. Hence there is a tradeoff between exploration to estimate the quality of new pages and exploitation of pages already known to be of high quality. We study this tradeoff both analytically and via simulation, in the context of an economic objective function based on aggregate result quality amortized over time. We show that a modest amount of randomness leads to improved search results.",Information Retrieval

Open Access (OA) means: free online access to all peer-reviewed journal articles. Jean-Claude Guedon argues against the efficacy of author self-archiving of peer-reviewed journal articles (the ""Green"" road to OA). He suggests instead that we should convert to Open Access Publishing (the ""Golden"" road to OA) by ""mixing and matching"" Green and Gold as follows: o First, self-archive dissertations (not published, peer-reviewed journal articles). o Second, identify and tag how those dissertations have been evaluated and reviewed. o Third, self-archive unrefereed preprints (not published, peer-reviewed journal articles). o Fourth, develop new mechanisms for evaluating and reviewing those unrefereed preprints, at multiple levels. The result will be OA Publishing (Gold). I argue that rather than yet another 10 years of speculation like this, what is actually needed (and imminent) is for OA self-archiving to be mandated by research funders and institutions so that the self-archiving of published, peer-reviewed journal articles (Green) can be fast-forwarded to 100% OA.",Information Retrieval

We noticed that query expansion is often incorrect because of a bad understanding of the question. But the automatic good understanding of an utterance is linked to the context length, and the question are often short. This methodology proposes to analyse the documents and to construct an informative structure from the results of the analysis and from a semantic text expansion. The linguistic analysis identifies words (tokenization and morphological analysis), links between words (syntactic analysis) and word sense (semantic disambiguation). The text expansion adds to each word the synonyms matching its sense and replaces the words in the utterances by derivatives, modifying the syntactic schema if necessary. In this way, whatever enrichment may be, the text keeps the same meaning, but each piece of information matches many realisations. The questioning method consists in constructing a local informative structure without enrichment, and matches it with the documentary structure. If a sentence in the informative structure matches the question structure, this sentence is the answer to the question.",Information Retrieval

These methods enrich a document with data that are semantically equivalent, in order to improve recall. For instance, some of these methods use synonym dictionaries. These dictionaries enrich a sentence with words that have a similar meaning. However, these methods present some serious drawbacks, since words are usually synonyms only in restricted contexts. The method we propose here consists of using word sense disambiguation rules (WSD) to restrict the selection of synonyms to only these that match a specific syntactico-semantic context. We show how WSD rules are built and how information extraction techniques can benefit from the application of these rules.",Information Retrieval

  Relevant?","The main aspects of XML retrieval are identified by analysing and comparing the following two behaviours: the behaviour of the assessor when judging the relevance of returned document components; and the behaviour of users when interacting with components of XML documents. We argue that the two INEX relevance dimensions, Exhaustivity and Specificity, are not orthogonal dimensions; indeed, an empirical analysis of each dimension reveals that the grades of the two dimensions are correlated to each other. By analysing the level of agreement between the assessor and the users, we aim at identifying the best units of retrieval. The results of our analysis show that the highest level of agreement is on highly relevant and on non-relevant document components, suggesting that only the end points of the INEX 10-point relevance scale are perceived in the same way by both the assessor and the users. We propose a new definition of relevance for XML retrieval and argue that its corresponding relevance scale would be a better choice for INEX.",Information Retrieval

  Database","This paper investigates the impact of three approaches to XML retrieval: using Zettair, a full-text information retrieval system; using eXist, a native XML database; and using a hybrid system that takes full article answers from Zettair and uses eXist to extract elements from those articles. For the content-only topics, we undertake a preliminary analysis of the INEX 2003 relevance assessments in order to identify the types of highly relevant document components. Further analysis identifies two complementary sub-cases of relevance assessments (""General"" and ""Specific"") and two categories of topics (""Broad"" and ""Narrow""). We develop a novel retrieval module that for a content-only topic utilises the information from the resulting answer list of a native XML database and dynamically determines the preferable units of retrieval, which we call ""Coherent Retrieval Elements"". The results of our experiments show that -- when each of the three systems is evaluated against different retrieval scenarios (such as different cases of relevance assessments, different topic categories and different choices of evaluation metrics) -- the XML retrieval systems exhibit varying behaviour and the best performance can be reached for different values of the retrieval parameters. In the case of INEX 2003 relevance assessments for the content-only topics, our newly developed hybrid XML retrieval system is substantially more effective than either Zettair or eXist, and yields a robust and a very effective XML retrieval.",Information Retrieval

INEX 2003 content-and-structure topics can be classified in two categories: the first retrieving full articles as final answers, and the second retrieving more specific elements within articles as final answers. We show that for both topic categories our initial hybrid system improves the retrieval effectiveness of a native XML database. For ranking the final answer elements, we propose and evaluate a novel retrieval model that utilises the structural relationships between the answer elements of a native XML database and retrieves Coherent Retrieval Elements. The final results of our experiments show that when the XML retrieval task focusses on highly relevant elements our hybrid XML retrieval system with the Coherent Retrieval Elements module is 1.8 times more effective than Zettair and 3 times more effective than eXist, and yields an effective content-and-structure XML retrieval.",Information Retrieval

We mix the selection of structured features with fine textual selection based on syntactic characteristics.We illustrate and evaluate this approach with a collection of Inria activity reports for the year 2003. The objective is to cluster projects into larger groups (Themes), based on the keywords or different chapters of these activity reports. We then compare the results of clustering using different feature selections, with the official theme structure used by Inria.",Information Retrieval

  Expertise Finding","In this paper, we present an algorithm for automatically building expertise evidence for finding experts within an organization by combining structured corporate information with different content. We also describe our test data collection and our evaluation method. Evaluation of the algorithm shows that using organizational structure leads to a significant improvement in the precision of finding an expert. Furthermore we evaluate the impact of using different data sources on the quality of the results and conclude that Expert Finding is not a ""one engine fits all"" solution. It requires an analysis of the information space into which a solution will be placed and the appropriate selection and weighting scheme of the data sources.",Information Retrieval
6880,Practical Semantic Analysis of Web Sites and Documents,"As Web sites are now ordinary products, it is necessary to explicit the notion of quality of a Web site. The quality of a site may be linked to the easiness of accessibility and also to other criteria such as the fact that the site is up to date and coherent. This last quality is difficult to insure because sites may be updated very frequently, may have many authors, may be partially generated and in this context proof-reading is very difficult. The same piece of information may be found in different occurrences, but also in data or meta-data, leading to the need for consistency checking. In this paper we make a parallel between programs and Web sites. We present some examples of semantic constraints that one would like to specify (constraints between the meaning of categories and sub-categories in a thematic directory, consistency between the organization chart and the rest of the site in an academic site). We present quickly the Natural Semantics, a way to specify the semantics of programming languages that inspires our works. Then we propose a specification language for semantic constraints in Web sites that, in conjunction with the well known ``make'' program, permits to generate some site verification tools by compiling the specification into Prolog code. We apply our method to a large XML document which is the scientific part of our institute activity report, tracking errors or inconsistencies and also constructing some indicators that can be used by the management of the institute.",Information Retrieval

  Authors","This paper presents a novel analysis and visualization of English Wikipedia data. Our specific interest is the analysis of basic statistics, the identification of the semantic structure and age of the categories in this free online encyclopedia, and the content coverage of its highly productive authors. The paper starts with an introduction of Wikipedia and a review of related work. We then introduce a suite of measures and approaches to analyze and map the semantic structure of Wikipedia. The results show that co-occurrences of categories within individual articles have a power-law distribution, and when mapped reveal the nicely clustered semantic structure of Wikipedia. The results also reveal the content coverage of the article's authors, although the roles these authors play are as varied as the authors themselves. We conclude with a discussion of major results and planned future work.",Information Retrieval

  Manufacturing Processes","The continuous improvement in TQM is considered as the core value by which organisation could maintain a competitive edge. Several techniques and tools are known to support this core value but most of the time these techniques are informal and without modelling the interdependence between the core value and tools. Thus, technique formalisation is one of TQM challenges for increasing efficiency of quality process implementation. In that way, the paper proposes and experiments an advanced quality modelling approach based on meta-modelling the ""process approach"" as advocated by the standard ISO9000:2000. This meta-model allows formalising the interdependence between technique, tools and core value",Information Retrieval
6885,A Flexible Structured-based Representation for XML Document Mining,"This paper reports on the INRIA group's approach to XML mining while participating in the INEX XML Mining track 2005. We use a flexible representation of XML documents that allows taking into account the structure only or both the structure and content. Our approach consists of representing XML documents by a set of their sub-paths, defined according to some criteria (length, root beginning, leaf ending). By considering those sub-paths as words, we can use standard methods for vocabulary reduction, and simple clustering methods such as K-means that scale well. We actually use an implementation of the clustering algorithm known as ""dynamic clouds"" that can work with distinct groups of independent variables put in separate variables. This is useful in our model since embedded sub-paths are not independent: we split potentially dependant paths into separate variables, resulting in each of them containing independant paths. Experiments with the INEX collections show good results for the structure-only collections, but our approach could not scale well for large structure-and-content collections.",Information Retrieval
6886,The uncovering of hidden structures by Latent Semantic Analysis,"Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) is a well known method for information retrieval. It has also been applied as a model of cognitive processing and word-meaning acquisition. This dual importance of LSA derives from its capacity to modulate the meaning of words by contexts, dealing successfully with polysemy and synonymy. The underlying reasons that make the method work are not clear enough. We propose that the method works because it detects an underlying block structure (the blocks corresponding to topics) in the term by document matrix. In real cases this block structure is hidden because of perturbations. We propose that the correct explanation for LSA must be searched in the structure of singular vectors rather than in the profile of singular values. Using Perron-Frobenius theory we show that the presence of disjoint blocks of documents is marked by sign-homogeneous entries in the vectors corresponding to the documents of one block and zeros elsewhere. In the case of nearly disjoint blocks, perturbation theory shows that if the perturbations are small the zeros in the leading vectors are replaced by small numbers (pseudo-zeros). Since the singular values of each block might be very different in magnitude, their order does not mirror the order of blocks. When the norms of the blocks are similar, LSA works fine, but we propose that when the topics have different sizes, the usual procedure of selecting the first k singular triplets (k being the number of blocks) should be replaced by a method that selects the perturbed Perron vectors for each block.",Information Retrieval

6889,Context-sensitive access to e-document corpus,"The methodology of context-sensitive access to e-documents considers context as a problem model based on the knowledge extracted from the application domain, and presented in the form of application ontology. Efficient access to an information in the text form is needed. Wiki resources as a modern text format provides huge number of text in a semi formalized structure. At the first stage of the methodology, documents are indexed against the ontology representing macro-situation. The indexing method uses a topic tree as a middle layer between documents and the application ontology. At the second stage documents relevant to the current situation (the abstract and operational contexts) are identified and sorted by degree of relevance. Abstract context is a problem-oriented ontology-based model. Operational context is an instantiation of the abstract context with data provided by the information sources. The following parts of the methodology are described: (i) metrics for measuring similarity of e-documents to ontology, (ii) a document index storing results of indexing of e-documents against the ontology; (iii) a method for identification of relevant e-documents based on semantic similarity measures. Wikipedia (wiki resource) is used as a corpus of e-documents for approach evaluation in a case study.

6890,"Scatter Networks: A New Approach for Analyzing Information Scatter on
  the Web","Information on any given topic is often scattered across the web. Previously this scatter has been characterized through the distribution of a set of facts (i.e. pieces of information) across web pages, showing that typically a few pages contain many facts on the topic, while many pages contain just a few. While such approaches have revealed important scatter phenomena, they are lossy in that they conceal how specific facts (e.g. rare facts) occur in specific types of pages (e.g. fact-rich pages). To reveal such regularities, we construct bi-partite networks, consisting of two types of vertices: the facts contained in webpages and the webpages themselves. Such a representation enables the application of a series of network analysis techniques, revealing structural features such as connectivity, robustness, and clustering. We discuss the implications of each of these features to the users' ability to find comprehensive information online. Finally, we compare the bipartite graph structure of webpages and facts with the hyperlink structure between the webpages.",Information Retrieval

A two-fold purpose lies behind this experiment. The first aim is to investigate the feasibility, define methods and procedures for combining two Italian lexical resources that have incompatible formats and complementary information into a Unified Lexicon (UL). The adopted strategy and the procedures appointed are described together with the driving criterion of the merging task, where a balance between human and computational efforts is pursued. The coverage of the UL has been maximized, by making use of simple and fast matching procedures. The second aim is to exploit this newly obtained resource for implementing the phonological and morphological layers of the CLIPS lexical database. Implementing these new layers and linking them with the already exisitng syntactic and semantic layers is not a trivial task. The constraints imposed by the model, the impact at the architectural level and the solution adopted in order to make the whole database `speak' efficiently are presented.

Along with a general rise of user generated content there are more and more tagging systems that allow users to annotate digital resources with tags (keywords) and share their annotations with other users. Tagging is frequently seen in contrast to traditional knowledge organization systems or as something completely new. This paper shows that tagging should better be seen as a popular form of manual indexing on the Web. Difference between controlled and free indexing blurs with sufficient feedback mechanisms. A revised typology of tagging systems is presented that includes different user roles and knowledge organization systems with hierarchical relationships and vocabulary control.

A formal framework for ``hierarchy'' is given by an ultrametric topology. This provides us with a theoretical foundation for concept hierarchy creation. A major objective is {\em scalable} annotation or labeling of concept maps. Serendipitously we pursue other objectives such as deriving common word pair (and triplet) phrases, i.e., word 2- and 3-grams. We evaluate our approach using (i) a collection of texts, (ii) a single text subdivided into successive parts (for which we provide an interactive demonstrator), and (iii) a text subdivided at the sentence or line level. While detailing a generic framework, a distinguishing feature of our work is that we focus on {\em locality} of hierarchic structure in order to extract semantic information.",Information Retrieval

We identify some of the problems associated with wikis to include, (a) identification of the identities of information and its creator (b) accuracy of information (c) justification of the credibility of authors (d) vandalism of quality of information (e) weak control over the contents. A solution to some of these problems is sought through the use of an annotation model. The model assumes that contributions in wikis can be seen as annotation to the initial document. It proposed a systematic control of contributors and contributions to the initiative and the keeping of records of what existed and what was done to initial documents. We believe that with this model, analysis can be done on the progress of wiki initiatives. We assumed that using this model, wikis can be better used for creation and sharing of knowledge for public use.",Information Retrieval

Most of the annotation tools existing today were conceived for their independent use with no reference to the creator of the annotation. We propose AMIEDoT (Annotation Model for Information Exchange and Document Tracking) an annotation model that can assist in document tracking and recommendation service. The model is based on three parameters in the acts of annotation. We believe that introducing document parameters, time and the parameters of the creator of annotation into an annotation process can be a dependable source to know, who used a document, when a document was used and for what a document was used for. Beyond document tracking, our model can be used in not only for selective dissemination of information but for recommendation services.

  Matching","In a way similar to the string-to-string correction problem we address time series similarity in the light of a time-series-to-time-series-correction problem for which the similarity between two time series is measured as the minimum cost sequence of ""edit operations"" needed to transform one time series into another. To define the ""edit operations"" we use the paradigm of a graphical editing process and end up with a dynamic programming algorithm that we call Time Warp Edit Distance (TWED). TWED is slightly different in form from Dynamic Time Warping, Longest Common Subsequence or Edit Distance with Real Penalty algorithms. In particular, it highlights a parameter which drives a kind of stiffness of the elastic measure along the time axis. We show that the similarity provided by TWED is a metric potentially useful in time series retrieval applications since it could benefit from the triangular inequality property to speed up the retrieval process while tuning the parameters of the elastic measure. In that context, a lower bound is derived to relate the matching of time series into down sampled representation spaces to the matching into the original space. Empiric quality of the TWED distance is evaluated on a simple classification task. Compared to Edit Distance, Dynamic Time Warping, Longest Common Subsequnce and Edit Distance with Real Penalty, TWED has proven to be quite effective on the considered experimental task.",Information Retrieval

Among several strategies, two are discussed in detail with examples of applications. On the one hand, conceptual specifications for linking and assembling are embedded in the resource meta-description with the support of the ontology of the domain to facilitate meta-communication. Resources are like agents looking for conceptual acquaintances with intention. On the other hand, the domain ontology and an argumentative ontology drive the linking and assembling strategies.",Information Retrieval

The complete collection is then explored.

However, there has been little research on the topological properties of individual web sites. In this paper, we consider whether web sites (as opposed to the entire Web) exhibit structural similarities. To do so, we exhaustively crawled 18 web sites as diverse as governmental departments, commercial companies and university departments in different countries. These web sites consisted of as little as a few thousand pages to millions of pages. Statistical analysis of these 18 sites revealed that the internal link structure of the web sites are significantly different when measured with first and second-order topological properties, i.e. properties based on the connectivity of an individual or a pairs of nodes. However, examination of a third-order topological property that consider the connectivity between three nodes that form a triangle, revealed a strong correspondence across web sites, suggestive of an invariant. Comparison with the Web, the AS Internet, and a citation network, showed that this third-order property is not shared across other types of networks.

The difficulty which arises is no longer the existence of information but rather the access to this information. When designing multimedia information retrieval system, it is appropriate to bear in mind the potential users and their information needs. We assumed that multimedia information representation which takes into account explicitly the users' needs and the cases of use could contribute to the adaptation potentials of the system for the end-users. We believe also that responses of multimedia information system would be more relevant to the users' needs if the types of results to be used from the system were identified before the design and development of the system. We propose the integration of the users' information needs. More precisely integrating usage contexts of resulting information in an information system (during creation and feedback) should enhance more pertinent users' need. The first section of this study is dedicated to traditional multimedia information systems and specifically the approaches of representing multimedia information. Taking into account the dynamism of users, these approaches do not permit the explicit integration of the users' information needs.

Each rater evaluates a subset of objects leading to a n x m rating matrix with a certain sparsity pattern. From this rating matrix we give a nonlinear formula to define the reputation of raters and objects. We also provide an iterative algorithm that superlinearly converges to the unique vector of reputations and this for any rating matrix. In contrast to classical outliers detection, no evaluation is discarded in this method but each one is taken into account with different weights for the reputation of the objects. The complexity of one iteration step is linear in the number of evaluations, making our algorithm efficient for large data set. Experiments show good robustness of the reputation of the objects against cheaters and spammers and good detection properties of cheaters and spammers.",Information Retrieval

At the same time, the intrinsic dimension of a sample is easily corrupted by moderate high-dimensional noise (of the same amplitude as the size of the manifold) and suffers from prohibitevely high computational complexity (computing it is an $NP$-complete problem). We outline a possible way to overcome these difficulties.",Information Retrieval

In this paper we analyze the online computation of rankings of users associated to facets made up of multiple tags. Possible applications are user reputation evaluation (ego-ranking) and improvement of content quality in case of retrieval. We propose a solution based on PageRank as centrality measure: (i) a ranking for each tag is computed offline on the basis of the corresponding tag-dependent subgraph; (ii) a faceted order is generated by merging rankings corresponding to all the tags in the facet. The fundamental assumption, validated by empirical observations, is that step (i) is scalable.

VOIR uses region-based relevance feedback to improve the quality of the results in each query session and to discover new associations between text and image. This paper describes a user-centred and task-oriented comparative evaluation of VOIR which was undertaken considering three distinct versions of VOIR: a full-fledge version; one supporting relevance feedback only at image level; and a third version not supporting relevance feedback at all.

These problems are often compounded when keyword based search methodologies are not adequate for describing the information you seek. In many instances, information such as Web site URLs, phone numbers, etc. can often be better identified through the use of a textual pattern than by keyword. For example, many more phone numbers could be picked up by a search for the pattern (XXX) XXX-XXXX, where X could be any digit, than would be by a search for any specific phone number (i.e. the keyword approach). Programming languages typically allow for the matching of textual patterns via the usage of regular expressions.

However, by integrating the social activities of music bloggers and listeners, we are able to overcome this limitation: improving the quality of the blogroll neighborhoods, in terms of similarity, by 85 percent when using tracks and by 120 percent when integrating tags from another site.",Information Retrieval
6921,Weighted Naive Bayes Model for Semi-Structured Document Categorization,"The aim of this paper is the supervised classification of semi-structured data. A formal model based on bayesian classification is developed while addressing the integration of the document structure into classification tasks. We define what we call the structural context of occurrence for unstructured data, and we derive a recursive formulation in which parameters are used to weight the contribution of structural element relatively to the others. A simplified version of this formal model is implemented to carry out textual documents classification experiments. First results show, for a adhoc weighting strategy, that the structural context of word occurrences has a significant impact on classification results comparing to the performance of a simple multinomial naive Bayes classifier. The proposed implementation competes on the Reuters-21578 data with the SVM classifier associated or not with the splitting of structural components. These results encourage exploring the learning of acceptable weighting strategies for this model, in particular boosting strategies.",Information Retrieval

  Fourier Series Expansion","In addition to the frequency of terms in a document collection, the distribution of terms plays an important role in determining the relevance of documents for a given search query. In this paper, term distribution analysis using Fourier series expansion as a novel approach for calculating an abstract representation of term positions in a document corpus is introduced. Based on this approach, two methods for improving the evaluation of document relevance are proposed: (a) a function-based ranking optimization representing a user defined document region, and (b) a query expansion technique based on overlapping the term distributions in the top-ranked documents. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in providing new possibilities for optimizing the retrieval process.",Information Retrieval

  Web Snippets","When searching the web, it is often possible that there are too many results available for ambiguous queries. Text snippets, extracted from the retrieved pages, are an indicator of the pages' usefulness to the query intention and can be used to focus the scope of search results. In this paper, we propose a novel method for automatically extracting web page snippets that are highly relevant to the query intention and expressive of the pages' entire content. We show that the usage of semantics, as a basis for focused retrieval, produces high quality text snippet suggestions. The snippets delivered by our method are significantly better in terms of retrieval performance compared to those derived using the pages' statistical content. Furthermore, our study suggests that semantically-driven snippet generation can also be used to augment traditional passage retrieval algorithms based on word overlap or statistical weights, since they typically differ in coverage and produce different results. User clicks on the query relevant snippets can be used to refine the query results and promote the most comprehensive among the relevant documents.",Information Retrieval

New content is produced in a daily basis and the work of traditional search engines turns to be insufficient due to the nature of weblogs. This work summarizes the structure of the blogosphere and highlights the special features of weblogs. In this paper we present a method for ranking weblogs based on the link graph and on several similarity characteristics between weblogs. First we create an enhanced graph of connected weblogs and add new types of edges and weights utilising many weblog features. Then, we assign a ranking to each weblog using our algorithm, BlogRank, which is a modified version of PageRank. For the validation of our method we run experiments on a weblog dataset, which we process and adapt to our search engine. (http://spiderwave.aueb.gr/Blogwave).

Collaborative tags contain rich information about personalized preferences and item contents, and are therefore potential to help in providing better recommendations. In this paper, we propose a recommendation algorithm based on an integrated diffusion on user-item-tag tripartite graphs.

To deal with the discrete ratings on objects, we use a multi-channel representation where each object is mapped to several channels with the number of channels being equal to the number of different ratings. Each channel represents a certain rating and a user having voted an object will be connected to the channel corresponding to the rating. Diffusion process taking place on such a user-channel bipartite graph gives a new similarity measure of user pairs, which is further demonstrated to be more accurate than the classical Pearson correlation coefficient under the standard collaborative filtering framework.",Information Retrieval

The goal of text summarization based on extraction approach is sentence selection. One of the methods to obtain the suitable sentences is to assign some numerical measure of a sentence for the summary called sentence weighting and then select the best ones. The first step in summarization by extraction is the identification of important features. In our experiment, we used 125 test documents in DUC2002 data set. Each document is prepared by preprocessing process: sentence segmentation, tokenization, removing stop word, and word stemming. Then, we use 8 important features and calculate their score for each sentence. We propose text summarization based on fuzzy logic to improve the quality of the summary created by the general statistic method. We compare our results with the baseline summarizer and Microsoft Word 2007 summarizers.

While surfing the internet it is difficult to deal with irrelevant pages and to predict which links lead to quality pages. In this paper a technique of effective focused crawling is implemented to improve the quality of web navigation. To check the similarity of web pages w.r.t. topic keywords a similarity function is used and the priorities of extracted out links are also calculated based on meta data and resultant pages generated from focused crawler.

Traditional 2D-embeddings of points can be used to create a basic layout, but these methods, by themselves, do not illustrate clusters and neighborhoods very well. In this paper, we propose the use of geographic maps to enhance the definition of clusters and neighborhoods, and consider the effectiveness of this approach in visualizing similarities and recommendations arising from TV shows and music selections.

In both the unweighted and weighted cases, the resource allocation index performs the best. To our surprise, the weighted indices perform worse, which reminds us of the well-known Weak Tie Theory. Further extensive experimental study shows that the weak ties play a significant role in the link prediction problem, and to emphasize the contribution of weak ties can remarkably enhance the predicting accuracy.",Information Retrieval

The proposed algorithm extends the idea of authority and hub scores from HITS by introducing two diagonal matrices which contain constants that act as weights to make authority pages more authoritative and hub pages more hubby. This method works because in the web graph good authorities are pointed to by good hubs and good hubs point to good authorities. Consequently, these pages will collect their scores faster under the proposed algorithm than under the standard HITS. We show that the authority and hub vectors of the proposed algorithm exist but are not necessarily be unique, and then give a treatment to ensure the uniqueness property of the vectors. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can improve HITS computations, especially for back button datasets.",Information Retrieval

Then, 3-way adjacency tensor is extracted from the network and the PARAFAC decomposition is applied to the tensor to get pairs of node lists and label lists with scores attached to each list as the indication of the degree of importance. The clustering is done by sorting the lists in decreasing order and taking the pairs of top ranked blogs and words. Thus, unlike standard co-clustering methods, this method not only groups the similar blogs with their descriptive words but also tends to produce clusters of important blogs and descriptive words.",Information Retrieval

6956,Learning to Blend by Relevance,"Emergence of various vertical search engines highlights the fact that a single ranking technology cannot deal with the complexity and scale of search problems. For example, technology behind video and image search is very different from general web search. Their ranking functions share few features. Question answering websites (e.g., Yahoo! Answer) can make use of text matching and click features developed for general web, but they have unique page structures and rich user feedback, e.g., thumbs up and thumbs down ratings in Yahoo! answer, which greatly benefit their own ranking. Even for those features shared by answer and general web, the correlation between features and relevance could be very different. Therefore, dedicated functions are needed in order to better rank documents within individual domains. These dedicated functions are defined on distinct feature spaces. However, having one search box for each domain, is neither efficient nor scalable. Rather than typing the same query two times into both Yahoo! Search and Yahoo! Answer and retrieving two ranking lists, we would prefer putting it only once but receiving a comprehensive list of documents from both domains on the subject. This situation calls for new technology that blends documents from different sources into a single ranking list.

Therefore, the search engines sometimes do not provide sufficient information to the users. New methods based on the semantics of user keywords must be developed to search in the vast web space without incurring loss of information. The semantic based information retrieval techniques need to understand the meaning of the concepts in the user queries. This will improve the precision-recall of the search results. Therefore, this approach focuses on the concept based semantic information retrieval. This work is based on Word sense disambiguation, thesaurus WordNet and ontology of any domain for retrieving information in order to capture the context of particular concept(s) and discover semantic relationships between them.",Information Retrieval
6967,Formal Concept Analysis for Information Retrieval,"In this paper we describe a mechanism to improve Information Retrieval (IR) on the web. The method is based on Formal Concepts Analysis (FCA) that it is makes semantical relations during the queries, and allows a reorganizing, in the shape of a lattice of concepts, the answers provided by a search engine. We proposed for the IR an incremental algorithm based on Galois lattice. This algorithm allows a formal clustering of the data sources, and the results which it turns over are classified by order of relevance. The control of relevance is exploited in clustering, we improved the result by using ontology in field of image processing, and reformulating the user queries which make it possible to give more relevant documents.",Information Retrieval
6968,"An Analytical Approach to Document Clustering Based on Internal
  Criterion Function","Fast and high quality document clustering is an important task in organizing information, search engine results obtaining from user query, enhancing web crawling and information retrieval. With the large amount of data available and with a goal of creating good quality clusters, a variety of algorithms have been developed having quality-complexity trade-offs. Among these, some algorithms seek to minimize the computational complexity using certain criterion functions which are defined for the whole set of clustering solution. In this paper, we are proposing a novel document clustering algorithm based on an internal criterion function. Most commonly used partitioning clustering algorithms (e.g. k-means) have some drawbacks as they suffer from local optimum solutions and creation of empty clusters as a clustering solution. The proposed algorithm usually does not suffer from these problems and converge to a global optimum, its performance enhances with the increase in number of clusters. We have checked our algorithm against three different datasets for four different values of k (required number of clusters).",Information Retrieval
6969,Revisiting the Examination Hypothesis with Query Specific Position Bias,"Click through rates (CTR) offer useful user feedback that can be used to infer the relevance of search results for queries. However it is not very meaningful to look at the raw click through rate of a search result because the likelihood of a result being clicked depends not only on its relevance but also the position in which it is displayed. One model of the browsing behavior, the {\em Examination Hypothesis} \cite{RDR07,Craswell08,DP08}, states that each position has a certain probability of being examined and is then clicked based on the relevance of the search snippets. This is based on eye tracking studies \cite{Claypool01, GJG04} which suggest that users are less likely to view results in lower positions. Such a position dependent variation in the probability of examining a document is referred to as {\em position bias}. Our main observation in this study is that the position bias tends to differ with the kind of information the user is looking for. This makes the position bias {\em query specific}. In this study, we present a model for analyzing a query specific position bias from the click data and use these biases to derive position independent relevance values of search results. Our model is based on the assumption that for a given query, the positional click through rate of a document is proportional to the product of its relevance and a {\em query specific} position bias. We compare our model with the vanilla examination hypothesis model (EH) on a set of queries obtained from search logs of a commercial search engine. We also compare it with the User Browsing Model (UBM) \cite{DP08} which extends the cascade model of Craswell et al\cite{Craswell08} by incorporating multiple clicks in a query session. We show that the our model, although much simpler to implement, consistently outperforms both EH and UBM on well-used measures such as relative error and cross entropy.",Information Retrieval

In this paper, we develop a real-time automatic harvesting agent for adverts posted on Servihoo web portal and an SMS-based notification system. It uses the URL of the web portal and the object model, i.e., the fields of interests and a set of rules written using the HTML parsing functions to extract latest adverts information.

In this scenario, identifying the frequently used links and placing them in the top left corner of the page will increase the user's satisfaction. This process will reduce the time spent by a visitor on the page, as most of the times, the popular links are presented in the visible part of the screen itself. Also, a site can be indexed based on the popular links in that page. This will increase the efficiency of the retrieval system.

How can one quickly find a member of the family which has a maximal intersection with the query set? Time constraints on the query and on a possible preprocessing of the set family make this problem challenging. Such maximal intersection queries arise in a wide range of applications, including web search, recommendation systems, and distributing on-line advertisements. In general, maximal intersection queries are computationally expensive. We investigate two well-motivated distributions over all families of sets and propose an algorithm for each of them. We show that with very high probability an almost optimal solution is found in time which is logarithmic in the size of the family. Moreover, we point out a threshold phenomenon on the probabilities of intersecting sets in each of our two input models which leads to the efficient algorithms mentioned above.",Information Retrieval

Hence, this makes a highly pertinent question for which graph centrality methods can provide an answer. In this paper the author offers a comprehensive survey of feasible algorithms for ranking users in social networks, he examines their vulnerabilities to linking malpractice in such networks, and suggests an objective criterion against which to compare such algorithms. Additionally, he suggests a first step towards ""desensitizing"" prestige algorithms against cheating by spammers and other abusive users.",Information Retrieval

Because of the tremendous usage of web, the web log files are growing at a faster rate and the size is becoming huge. Web data mining is the application of data mining techniques in web data. Web Usage Mining applies mining techniques in log data to extract the behavior of users which is used in various applications like personalized services, adaptive web sites, customer profiling, prefetching, creating attractive web sites etc., Web usage mining consists of three phases preprocessing, pattern discovery and pattern analysis. Web log data is usually noisy and ambiguous and preprocessing is an important process before mining. For discovering patterns sessions are to be constructed efficiently.

The PDDP algorithm recursively splits the data samples into two sub clusters using the hyper plane normal to the principal direction derived from the covariance matrix, which is the central logic of the algorithm. However, the PDDP algorithm can yield poor results, especially when clusters are not well separated from one another. To improve the quality of the clustering results problem, it is resolved by reallocating new cluster membership using the IB algorithm with different settings. IB Method gives accuracy but time consumption is more. Furthermore, based on the theoretical background of the sGEM algorithm and sequential Information Bottleneck method(sIB), it can be obvious to extend the framework to cover the problem of estimating the number of clusters using the Bayesian Information Criterion. Experimental results are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm with comparison to the existing algorithm.",Information Retrieval
6977,Is This a Good Title?,"Missing web pages, URIs that return the 404 ""Page Not Found"" error or the HTTP response code 200 but dereference unexpected content, are ubiquitous in today's browsing experience. We use Internet search engines to relocate such missing pages and provide means that help automate the rediscovery process. We propose querying web pages' titles against search engines. We investigate the retrieval performance of titles and compare them to lexical signatures which are derived from the pages' content. Since titles naturally represent the content of a document they intuitively change over time. We measure the edit distance between current titles and titles of copies of the same pages obtained from the Internet Archive and display their evolution. We further investigate the correlation between title changes and content modifications of a web page over time. Lastly we provide a predictive model for the quality of any given web page title in terms of its discovery performance. Our results show that titles return more than 60% URIs top ranked and further relevant content returned in the top 10 results. We show that titles decay slowly but are far more stable than the pages' content. We further distill stop titles than can help identify insufficiently performing search engine queries.",Information Retrieval

A generic platform is built for BiLingual Information retrieval which can be extended to any foreign or Indian language working with the same efficiency. Search for the solution of the query is not done in a specific predefined set of standard languages but is chosen dynamically on processing the user's query. This paper deals with Indian language Tamil apart from English. The task is to retrieve the solution for the user given query in the same language as that of the query. In this process, a Ontological tree is built for the domain in such a way that there are entries in the above listed two languages in every node of the tree. A Part-Of-Speech (POS) Tagger is used to determine the keywords from the given query. Based on the context, the keywords are translated to appropriate languages using the Ontological tree. A search is performed and documents are retrieved based on the keywords. With the use of the Ontological tree, Information Extraction is done. Finally, the solution for the query is translated back to the query language (if necessary) and produced to the user.",Information Retrieval

We examine the effect of spam on the results of the TREC 2009 web ad hoc and relevance feedback tasks, which used the ClueWeb09 dataset.

6984,Self-Taught Hashing for Fast Similarity Search,"The ability of fast similarity search at large scale is of great importance to many Information Retrieval (IR) applications. A promising way to accelerate similarity search is semantic hashing which designs compact binary codes for a large number of documents so that semantically similar documents are mapped to similar codes (within a short Hamming distance). Although some recently proposed techniques are able to generate high-quality codes for documents known in advance, obtaining the codes for previously unseen documents remains to be a very challenging problem. In this paper, we emphasise this issue and propose a novel Self-Taught Hashing (STH) approach to semantic hashing: we first find the optimal $l$-bit binary codes for all documents in the given corpus via unsupervised learning, and then train $l$ classifiers via supervised learning to predict the $l$-bit code for any query document unseen before. Our experiments on three real-world text datasets show that the proposed approach using binarised Laplacian Eigenmap (LapEig) and linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques significantly.",Information Retrieval

The information about links from websites to images is employed to create such a classifier. These links are represented as a bipartite website-image graph. Each vertex is equipped with scores of adultness and decentness. The scores for image vertexes are initialized with zero, those for website vertexes are initialized according to a text-based website classifier. An iterative algorithm that propagates scores within a website-image graph is described. The scores obtained are used to classify images by choosing an appropriate threshold. The experiments on Internet-scale data have shown that the algorithm under consideration increases classification recall by 17% in comparison with a simple algorithm which classifies an image as adult if it is connected with at least one adult site (at the same precision level).",Information Retrieval

  Algorithms For Music Information Retrieval","In this work we have compared two indexing algorithms that have been used to index and retrieve Carnatic music songs. We have compared a modified algorithm of the Dual ternary indexing algorithm for music indexing and retrieval with the multi-key hashing indexing algorithm proposed by us. The modification in the dual ternary algorithm was essential to handle variable length query phrase and to accommodate features specific to Carnatic music. The dual ternary indexing algorithm is adapted for Carnatic music by segmenting using the segmentation technique for Carnatic music. The dual ternary algorithm is compared with the multi-key hashing algorithm designed by us for indexing and retrieval in which features like MFCC, spectral flux, melody string and spectral centroid are used as features for indexing data into a hash table. The way in which collision resolution was handled by this hash table is different than the normal hash table approaches. It was observed that multi-key hashing based retrieval had a lesser time complexity than dual-ternary based indexing The algorithms were also compared for their precision and recall in which multi-key hashing had a better recall than modified dual ternary indexing for the sample data considered.",Information Retrieval
6988,An Optimal Trade-off between Content Freshness and Refresh Cost,"Caching is an effective mechanism for reducing bandwidth usage and alleviating server load. However, the use of caching entails a compromise between content freshness and refresh cost. An excessive refresh allows a high degree of content freshness at a greater cost of system resource. Conversely, a deficient refresh inhibits content freshness but saves the cost of resource usages. To address the freshness-cost problem, we formulate the refresh scheduling problem with a generic cost model and use this cost model to determine an optimal refresh frequency that gives the best tradeoff between refresh cost and content freshness. We prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal refresh frequency under the assumptions that the arrival of content update is Poisson and the age-related cost monotonically increases with decreasing freshness. In addition, we provide an analytic comparison of system performance under fixed refresh scheduling and random refresh scheduling, showing that with the same average refresh frequency two refresh schedulings are mathematically equivalent in terms of the long-run average cost.",Information Retrieval
6989,Cross-Lingual Adaptation using Structural Correspondence Learning,"Cross-lingual adaptation, a special case of domain adaptation, refers to the transfer of classification knowledge between two languages. In this article we describe an extension of Structural Correspondence Learning (SCL), a recently proposed algorithm for domain adaptation, for cross-lingual adaptation. The proposed method uses unlabeled documents from both languages, along with a word translation oracle, to induce cross-lingual feature correspondences. From these correspondences a cross-lingual representation is created that enables the transfer of classification knowledge from the source to the target language. The main advantages of this approach over other approaches are its resource efficiency and task specificity.   We conduct experiments in the area of cross-language topic and sentiment classification involving English as source language and German, French, and Japanese as target languages. The results show a significant improvement of the proposed method over a machine translation baseline, reducing the relative error due to cross-lingual adaptation by an average of 30% (topic classification) and 59% (sentiment classification). We further report on empirical analyses that reveal insights into the use of unlabeled data, the sensitivity with respect to important hyperparameters, and the nature of the induced cross-lingual correspondences.",Information Retrieval

In our tests we have a dataset of users who give ratings for some movies; we hide some values from the dataset, and we try to predict them again using its remaining portion (the so-called ""leave-n-out approach""). In order to use an Information Retrieval algorithm, we reformulate this Recommender Systems problem in this way: a user corresponds to a document, a movie corresponds to a term, the active user (whose rating we want to predict) plays the role of the query, and the ratings are used as weigths, in place of the weighting schema of the original IR algorithm. The output is the ranking list of the documents (""users"") relevant for the query (""active user""). We use the ratings of these users, weighted according to the rank, to predict the rating of the active user. We carry out the comparison by means of a typical metric, namely the accuracy of the predictions returned by the algorithm, and we compare this to the real ratings from users. In our first tests, we use two different Information Retrieval algorithms: LSPR, a recently proposed model based on Discrete Fourier Transform, and a simple vector space model.",Information Retrieval
6992,Text Classification using Artificial Intelligence,"Text classification is the process of classifying documents into predefined categories based on their content. It is the automated assignment of natural language texts to predefined categories. Text classification is the primary requirement of text retrieval systems, which retrieve texts in response to a user query, and text understanding systems, which transform text in some way such as producing summaries, answering questions or extracting data. Existing supervised learning algorithms for classifying text need sufficient documents to learn accurately. This paper presents a new algorithm for text classification using artificial intelligence technique that requires fewer documents for training. Instead of using words, word relation i.e. association rules from these words is used to derive feature set from pre-classified text documents. The concept of na\""ive Bayes classifier is then used on derived features and finally only a single concept of genetic algorithm has been added for final classification. A system based on the proposed algorithm has been implemented and tested. The experimental results show that the proposed system works as a successful text classifier.",Information Retrieval

  Sciences","Because of the increasing number of electronic data, designing efficient tools to retrieve and exploit documents is a major challenge. Current search engines suffer from two main drawbacks: there is limited interaction with the list of retrieved documents and no explanation for their adequacy to the query. Users may thus be confused by the selection and have no idea how to adapt their query so that the results match their expectations. This paper describes a request method and an environment based on aggregating models to assess the relevance of documents annotated by concepts of ontology. The selection of documents is then displayed in a semantic map to provide graphical indications that make explicit to what extent they match the user's query; this man/machine interface favors a more interactive exploration of data corpus.",Information Retrieval
7005,A Concept Annotation System for Clinical Records,"Unstructured information comprises a valuable source of data in clinical records. For text mining in clinical records, concept extraction is the first step in finding assertions and relationships. This study presents a system developed for the annotation of medical concepts, including medical problems, tests, and treatments, mentioned in clinical records. The system combines six publicly available named entity recognition system into one framework, and uses a simple voting scheme that allows to tune precision and recall of the system to specific needs. The system provides both a web service interface and a UIMA interface which can be easily used by other systems. The system was tested in the fourth i2b2 challenge and achieved an F-score of 82.1% for the concept exact match task, a score which is among the top-ranking systems. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available clinical record concept annotation system.",Information Retrieval

This paper discusses Collaborative Information Retrieval (CIR) and how it culminates to knowledge creation. It explains how created knowledge is organized and structured. It describes a functional architecture for the development of a CIR prototype called MECOCIR. Some of the features of the prototype are presented as well as how they facilitate collaborative knowledge exploitation.

7008,"Element Retrieval using Namespace Based on keyword search over XML
  Documents","Querying over XML elements using keyword search is steadily gaining popularity. The traditional similarity measure is widely employed in order to effectively retrieve various XML documents. A number of authors have already proposed different similarity-measure methods that take advantage of the structure and content of XML documents. They do not, however, consider the similarity between latent semantic information of element texts and that of keywords in a query. Although many algorithms on XML element search are available, some of them have the high computational complexity due to searching a huge number of elements. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm that makes use of the semantic similarity between elements instead of between entire XML documents, considering not only the structure and content of an XML document, but also semantic information of namespaces in elements. We compare our algorithm with the three other algorithms by testing on the real datasets. The experiments have demonstrated that our proposed method is able to improve the query accuracy, as well as to reduce the running time.",Information Retrieval

In this paper, we investigate analogies between ontologies on one hand, types, objects and data bases on the other one, taking into account the notion of evolution of an ontology. We represent a unique ontology using different paradigms, and observe that the distance between these different concepts is small.

7014,Query Expansion Based on Clustered Results,"Query expansion is a functionality of search engines that suggests a set of related queries for a user-issued keyword query. Typical corpus-driven keyword query expansion approaches return popular words in the results as expanded queries. Using these approaches, the expanded queries may correspond to a subset of possible query semantics, and thus miss relevant results. To handle ambiguous queries and exploratory queries, whose result relevance is difficult to judge, we propose a new framework for keyword query expansion: we start with clustering the results according to user specified granularity, and then generate expanded queries, such that one expanded query is generated for each cluster whose result set should ideally be the corresponding cluster. We formalize this problem and show its APX-hardness. Then we propose two efficient algorithms named iterative single-keyword refinement and partial elimination based convergence, respectively, which effectively generate a set of expanded queries from clustered results that provide a classification of the original query results. We believe our study of generating an optimal query based on the ground truth of the query results not only has applications in query expansion, but has significance for studying keyword search quality in general.",Information Retrieval

While efficacy of diversification approaches has been deeply investigated in the past, response time and scalability issues have been rarely addressed. A unified framework for studying performance and feasibility of result diversification solutions is thus proposed. First we define a new methodology for detecting when, and how, query results need to be diversified. To this purpose, we rely on the concept of ""query refinement"" to estimate the probability of a query to be ambiguous. Then, relying on this novel ambiguity detection method, we deploy and compare on a standard test set, three different diversification methods: IASelect, xQuAD, and OptSelect. While the first two are recent state-of-the-art proposals, the latter is an original algorithm introduced in this paper. We evaluate both the efficiency and the effectiveness of our approach against its competitors by using the standard TREC Web diversification track testbed. Results shown that OptSelect is able to run two orders of magnitude faster than the two other state-of-the-art approaches and to obtain comparable figures in diversification effectiveness.",Information Retrieval
7017,"Search for Hidden Knowledge in Collective Intelligence dealing
  Indeterminacy Ontology of Folksonomy with Linguistic Pragmatics and Quantum
  Logic","Information retrieval is not only the most frequent application executed on the Web but it is also the base of different types of applications. Considering collective intelligence of groups of individuals as a framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information we often cannot retrieve such knowledge being tacit. Tacit knowledge underlies many competitive capabilities and it is hard to articulate on discrete ontology structure. It is unstructured or unorganized, and therefore remains hidden. Developing generic solutions that can find the hidden knowledge is extremely complex. Moreover this will be a great challenge for the developers of semantic technologies. This work aims to explore ways to make explicit and available the tacit knowledge hidden in the collective intelligence of a collaborative environment within organizations. The environment was defined by folksonomies supported by a faceted semantic search. Vector space model which incorporates an analogy with the mathematical apparatus of quantum theory is adopted for the representation and manipulation of the meaning of folksonomy. Vector space retrieval has been proven efficiency when there isn't a data behavioural because it bears ranking algorithms involving a small number of types of elements and few operations. A solution to find what the user has in mind when posing a query could be based on ""joint meaning"" understood as a joint construal of the creator of the contents and the reader of the contents. The joint meaning was proposed to deal with vagueness on ontology of folksonomy indeterminacy, incompleteness and inconsistencies on collective intelligence. A proof-of concept prototype was built for collaborative environment as evolution of the actual social networks (like Facebook, LinkedIn,..) using the information visualization on a RIA application with Semantic Web techniques and technologies.",Information Retrieval
7018,Using Context to Improve the Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems,"The crucial role of the evaluation in the development of the information retrieval tools is useful evidence to improve the performance of these tools and the quality of results that they return. However, the classic evaluation approaches have limitations and shortcomings especially regarding to the user consideration, the measure of the adequacy between the query and the returned documents and the consideration of characteristics, specifications and behaviors of the search tool. Therefore, we believe that the exploitation of contextual elements could be a very good way to evaluate the search tools. So, this paper presents a new approach that takes into account the context during the evaluation process at three complementary levels. The experiments gives at the end of this article has shown the applicability of the proposed approach to real research tools. The tests were performed with the most popular searching engine (i.e. Google, Bing and Yahoo) selected in particular for their high selectivity. The obtained results revealed that the ability of these engines to rejecting dead links, redundant results and parasites pages depends strongly to how queries are formulated, and to the political of sites offering this information to present their content. The relevance evaluation of results provided by these engines, using the user's judgments, then using an automatic manner to take into account the query context has also shown a general decline in the perceived relevance according to the number of the considered results.",Information Retrieval

7020,A Linear-Time Approximation of the Earth Mover's Distance,"Color descriptors are one of the important features used in content-based image retrieval. The Dominant Color Descriptor (DCD) represents a few perceptually dominant colors in an image through color quantization. For image retrieval based on DCD, the earth mover's distance and the optimal color composition distance are proposed to measure the dissimilarity between two images. Although providing good retrieval results, both methods are too time-consuming to be used in a large image database. To solve the problem, we propose a new distance function that calculates an approximate earth mover's distance in linear time. To calculate the dissimilarity in linear time, the proposed approach employs the space-filling curve for multidimensional color space. To improve the accuracy, the proposed approach uses multiple curves and adjusts the color positions. As a result, our approach achieves order-of-magnitude time improvement but incurs small errors. We have performed extensive experiments to show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. The results reveal that our approach achieves almost the same results with the EMD in linear time.",Information Retrieval
7021,"PRESY: A Context Based Query Reformulation Tool for Information
  Retrieval on the Web","Problem Statement: The huge number of information on the web as well as the growth of new inexperienced users creates new challenges for information retrieval. It has become increasingly difficult for these users to find relevant documents that satisfy their individual needs. Certainly the current search engines (such as Google, Bing and Yahoo) offer an efficient way to browse the web content. However, the result quality is highly based on uses queries which need to be more precise to find relevant documents. This task still complicated for the majority of inept users who cannot express their needs with significant words in the query. For that reason, we believe that a reformulation of the initial user's query can be a good alternative to improve the information selectivity. This study proposes a novel approach and presents a prototype system called PRESY (Profile-based REformulation SYstem) for information retrieval on the web. Approach: It uses an incremental approach to categorize users by constructing a contextual base. The latter is composed of two types of context (static and dynamic) obtained using the users' profiles. The architecture proposed was implemented using .Net environment to perform queries reformulating tests. Results: The experiments gives at the end of this article show that the precision of the returned content is effectively improved. The tests were performed with the most popular searching engine (i.e. Google, Bind and Yahoo) selected in particular for their high selectivity. Among the given results, we found that query reformulation improve the first three results by 10.7% and 11.7% of the next seven returned elements. So as we can see the reformulation of users' initial queries improves the pertinence of returned content.",Information Retrieval

Our preliminary experiment on a simple ranking function has demonstrated the potential of the approach.",Information Retrieval
7023,Personalised Travel Recommendation based on Location Co-occurrence,"We propose a new task of recommending touristic locations based on a user's visiting history in a geographically remote region. This can be used to plan a touristic visit to a new city or country, or by travel agencies to provide personalised travel deals.   A set of geotags is used to compute a location similarity model between two different regions. The similarity between two landmarks is derived from the number of users that have visited both places, using a Gaussian density estimation of the co-occurrence space of location visits to cluster related geotags. The standard deviation of the kernel can be used as a scale parameter that determines the size of the recommended landmarks.   A personalised recommendation based on the location similarity model is evaluated on city and country scale and is able to outperform a location ranking based on popularity. Especially when a tourist filter based on visit duration is enforced, the prediction can be accurately adapted to the preference of the user. An extensive evaluation based on manual annotations shows that more strict ranking methods like cosine similarity and a proposed RankDiff algorithm provide more serendipitous recommendations and are able to link similar locations on opposite sides of the world.",Information Retrieval

But this lead to missing innumerable structured information about real-world objects embedded in static Web pages and online Web databases. Page-level information retrieval (IR) can unfortunately lead to highly inaccurate relevance ranking in answering object-oriented queries. On the other hand, Object Oriented Information Computing (OOIC) is promising and greatly reduces the complexity of the system while improving reusability and manageability. The most distinguishing requirement of today's complex heterogeneous systems is the need of the computing system to instantly adapt to vigorously changing conditions. OOIC allows reflecting the dynamic characteristics of the applications by instantiating objects dynamically. In this paper, major challenges of OOIC as well as its rudiments are recapped. The review includes the insight to PopRank Model and comparison analysis of conventional page rank based IR with OOIC",Information Retrieval
7026,On the Impact of Random Index-Partitioning on Index Compression,"The performance of processing search queries depends heavily on the stored index size. Accordingly, considerable research efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient compression techniques for inverted indexes. Roughly, index compression relies on two factors: the ordering of the indexed documents, which strives to position similar documents in proximity, and the encoding of the inverted lists that result from the ordered stream of documents. Large commercial search engines index tens of billions of pages of the ever growing Web. The sheer size of their indexes dictates the distribution of documents among thousands of servers in a scheme called local index-partitioning, such that each server indexes only several millions pages. Due to engineering and runtime performance considerations, random distribution of documents to servers is common. However, random index-partitioning among many servers adversely impacts the resulting index sizes, as it decreases the effectiveness of document ordering schemes. We study the impact of random index-partitioning on document ordering schemes. We show that index-partitioning decreases the aggregated size of the inverted lists logarithmically with the number of servers, when documents within each server are randomly reordered. On the other hand, the aggregated partitioned index size increases logarithmically with the number of servers, when state-of-the-art document ordering schemes, such as lexical URL sorting and clustering with TSP, are applied. Finally, we justify the common practice of randomly distributing documents to servers, as we qualitatively show that despite its ill-effects on the ensuing compression, it decreases key factors in distributed query evaluation time by an order of magnitude as compared with partitioning techniques that compress better.",Information Retrieval
7027,Factorization-based Lossless Compression of Inverted Indices,"Many large-scale Web applications that require ranked top-k retrieval such as Web search and online advertising are implemented using inverted indices. An inverted index represents a sparse term-document matrix, where non-zero elements indicate the strength of term-document association. In this work, we present an approach for lossless compression of inverted indices. Our approach maps terms in a document corpus to a new term space in order to reduce the number of non-zero elements in the term-document matrix, resulting in a more compact inverted index. We formulate the problem of selecting a new term space that minimizes the resulting index size as a matrix factorization problem, and prove that finding the optimal factorization is an NP-hard problem. We develop a greedy algorithm for finding an approximate solution. A side effect of our approach is increasing the number of terms in the index, which may negatively affect query evaluation performance. To eliminate such effect, we develop a methodology for modifying query evaluation algorithms by exploiting specific properties of our compression approach. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves an index size reduction of 20%, while maintaining the same query response times. Higher compression ratios up to 35% are achievable, however at the cost of slightly longer query response times. Furthermore, combining our approach with other lossless compression techniques, namely variable-byte encoding, leads to index size reduction of up to 50%.",Information Retrieval
7028,Efficient Query Rewrite for Structured Web Queries,"Web search engines and specialized online verticals are increasingly incorporating results from structured data sources to answer semantically rich user queries. For example, the query \WebQuery{Samsung 50 inch led tv} can be answered using information from a table of television data. However, the users are not domain experts and quite often enter values that do not match precisely the underlying data. Samsung makes 46- or 55- inch led tvs, but not 50-inch ones. So a literal execution of the above mentioned query will return zero results. For optimal user experience, a search engine would prefer to return at least a minimum number of results as close to the original query as possible. Furthermore, due to typical fast retrieval speeds in web-search, a search engine query execution is time-bound.   In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing algorithms that rewrite the user query in a principled manner, surfacing at least the required number of results while satisfying the low-latency constraint. We formalize these requirements and introduce a general formulation of the problem. We show that under a natural formulation, the problem is NP-Hard to solve optimally, and present approximation algorithms that produce good rewrites. We empirically validate our algorithms on large-scale data obtained from a commercial search engine's shopping vertical.",Information Retrieval
7029,Structured Learning of Two-Level Dynamic Rankings,"For ambiguous queries, conventional retrieval systems are bound by two conflicting goals. On the one hand, they should diversify and strive to present results for as many query intents as possible. On the other hand, they should provide depth for each intent by displaying more than a single result. Since both diversity and depth cannot be achieved simultaneously in the conventional static retrieval model, we propose a new dynamic ranking approach. Dynamic ranking models allow users to adapt the ranking through interaction, thus overcoming the constraints of presenting a one-size-fits-all static ranking. In particular, we propose a new two-level dynamic ranking model for presenting search results to the user. In this model, a user's interactions with the first-level ranking are used to infer this user's intent, so that second-level rankings can be inserted to provide more results relevant for this intent. Unlike for previous dynamic ranking models, we provide an algorithm to efficiently compute dynamic rankings with provable approximation guarantees for a large family of performance measures. We also propose the first principled algorithm for learning dynamic ranking functions from training data. In addition to the theoretical results, we provide empirical evidence demonstrating the gains in retrieval quality that our method achieves over conventional approaches.",Information Retrieval

7034,Orthogonal Query Expansion,"Over the last fifteen years, web searching has seen tremendous improvements. Starting from a nearly random collection of matching pages in 1995, today, search engines tend to satisfy the user's informational need on well-formulated queries. One of the main remaining challenges is to satisfy the users' needs when they provide a poorly formulated query. When the pages matching the user's original keywords are judged to be unsatisfactory, query expansion techniques are used to alter the result set. These techniques find keywords that are similar to the keywords given by the user, which are then appended to the original query leading to a perturbation of the result set. However, when the original query is sufficiently ill-posed, the user's informational need is best met using entirely different keywords, and a small perturbation of the original result set is bound to fail.   We propose a novel approach that is not based on the keywords of the original query. We intentionally seek out orthogonal queries, which are related queries that have low similarity to the user's query. The result sets of orthogonal queries intersect with the result set of the original query on a small number of pages. An orthogonal query can access the user's informational need while consisting of entirely different terms than the original query. We illustrate the effectiveness of our approach by proposing a query expansion method derived from these observations that improves upon results obtained using the Yahoo BOSS infrastructure.",Information Retrieval

  for reasonable quality?","This paper aims to review the fiercely discussed question of whether the ranking of Wikipedia articles in search engines is justified by the quality of the articles. After an overview of current research on information quality in Wikipedia, a summary of the extended discussion on the quality of encyclopedic entries in general is given. On this basis, a heuristic method for evaluating Wikipedia entries is developed and applied to Wikipedia articles that scored highly in a search engine retrieval effectiveness test and compared with the relevance judgment of jurors. In all search engines tested, Wikipedia results are unanimously judged better by the jurors than other results on the corresponding results position. Relevance judgments often roughly correspond with the results from the heuristic evaluation. Cases in which high relevance judgments are not in accordance with the comparatively low score from the heuristic evaluation are interpreted as an indicator of a high degree of trust in Wikipedia. One of the systemic shortcomings of Wikipedia lies in its necessarily incoherent user model. A further tuning of the suggested criteria catalogue, for instance the different weighing of the supplied criteria, could serve as a starting point for a user model differentiated evaluation of Wikipedia articles. Approved methods of quality evaluation of reference works are applied to Wikipedia articles and integrated with the question of search engine evaluation.",Information Retrieval

7042,Offering A Product Recommendation System in E-commerce,"This paper proposes a number of explicit and implicit ratings in product recommendation system for Business-to-customer e-commerce purposes. The system recommends the products to a new user. It depends on the purchase pattern of previous users whose purchase pattern is close to that of a user who asks for a recommendation. The system is based on weighted cosine similarity measure to find out the closest user profile among the profiles of all users in database. It also implements Association rule mining rule in recommending the products. Also, this product recommendation system takes into consideration the time of transaction of purchasing the items, thus eliminating sequence recognition problem. Experimental result shows for implicit rating, the proposed method gives acceptable performance in recommending the products. It also shows introduction of association rule improves the performance measure of recommendation system.",Information Retrieval
7043,"A New Approach to Design Graph Based Search Engine for Multiple Domains
  Using Different Ontologies","Search Engine has become a major tool for searching any information from the World Wide Web (WWW). While searching the huge digital library available in the WWW, every effort is made to retrieve the most relevant results. But in WWW majority of the Web pages are in HTML format and there are no such tags which tells the crawler to find any specific domain. To find more relevant result we use Ontology for that particular domain. If we are working with multiple domains then we use multiple ontologies. Now in order to design a domain specific search engine for multiple domains, crawler must crawl through the domain specific Web pages in the WWW according to the predefined ontologies.",Information Retrieval

  Detection of Deterministic Signals","We consider a decentralized detection problem in a power-constrained wireless sensor networks (WSNs), in which a number of sensor nodes collaborate to detect the presence of a deterministic vector signal. The signal to be detected is assumed known \emph{a priori}. Given a constraint on the total amount of transmit power, we investigate the optimal linear precoding design for each sensor node. More specifically, in order to achieve the best detection performance, shall sensor nodes transmit their raw data to the fusion center (FC), or transmit compressed versions of their original data? The optimal power allocation among sensors is studied as well. Also, assuming a fixed total transmit power, we examine how the detection performance behaves with the number of sensors in the network. A new concept ""detection outage"" is proposed to quantify the reliability of the overall detection system. Finally, decentralized detection with unknown signals is studied. Numerical results are conducted to corroborate our theoretical analysis and to illustrate the performance of the proposed algorithm.",Information Retrieval

The underlying premise of the approach is that in the case of cluster accesses, the next pages requested by users of the Web server are typically based on the current and previous pages requested. Based on same, rules are drawn which then lead the path for prefetching the desired pages. To carry out the desired task of prefetching the more relevant pages, agents have been introduced.",Information Retrieval

The extracted information provides the organizations with the ability to produce results more effectively to improve their businesses and increasing of sales. Co-clustering is a powerful bipartition technique which identifies group of users associated to group of web pages. These associations are quantified to reveal the users' interest in the different web pages' clusters. In this paper, Fuzzy Co-Clustering algorithm is proposed for clickstream data to identify the subset of users of similar navigational behavior /interest over a subset of web pages of a website. Targeting the users group for various promotional activities is an important aspect of marketing practices. Experiments are conducted on real dataset to prove the efficiency of proposed algorithm.

7048,Hierarchical Composable Optimization of Web Pages,"The process of creating modern Web media experiences is challenged by the need to adapt the content and presentation choices to dynamic real-time fluctuations of user interest across multiple audiences. We introduce FAME - a Framework for Agile Media Experiences - which addresses this scalability problem. FAME allows media creators to define abstract page models that are subsequently transformed into real experiences through algorithmic experimentation. FAME's page models are hierarchically composed of simple building blocks, mirroring the structure of most Web pages. They are resolved into concrete page instances by pluggable algorithms which optimize the pages for specific business goals. Our framework allows retrieving dynamic content from multiple sources, defining the experimentation's degrees of freedom, and constraining the algorithmic choices. It offers an effective separation of concerns in the media creation process, enabling multiple stakeholders with profoundly different skills to apply their crafts and perform their duties independently, composing and reusing each other's work in modular ways.",Information Retrieval
7049,Modeling Perceived Relevance for Tail Queries without Click-Through Data,"Click-through data has been used in various ways in Web search such as estimating relevance between documents and queries. Since only search snippets are perceived by users before issuing any clicks, the relevance induced by clicks are usually called \emph{perceived relevance} which has proven to be quite useful for Web search. While there is plenty of click data for popular queries, very little information is available for unpopular tail ones. These tail queries take a large portion of the search volume but search accuracy for these queries is usually unsatisfactory due to data sparseness such as limited click information. In this paper, we study the problem of modeling perceived relevance for queries without click-through data. Instead of relying on users' click data, we carefully design a set of snippet features and use them to approximately capture the perceived relevance. We study the effectiveness of this set of snippet features in two settings: (1) predicting perceived relevance and (2) enhancing search engine ranking. Experimental results show that our proposed model is effective to predict the relative perceived relevance of Web search results. Furthermore, our proposed snippet features are effective to improve search accuracy for longer tail queries without click-through data.",Information Retrieval

The annotated corpus is fed into an automatic summarizer for query-oriented abstract ranking and multi- abstract summarization. To adapt the summarizer to these two tasks, two novel weighting functions were devised in order to take into account the distribution of the tags in the corpus. Results, although still preliminary, are encouraging us to pursue this line of work and find better ways of building IR systems that can take into account semantic annotations in a corpus.",Information Retrieval

In the past, segmentation strategies were mainly validated against manual annotations. Our work shows that the goodness of a segmentation algorithm as judged through evaluation against a handful of human annotated segmentations hardly reflects its effectiveness in an IR-based setup. In fact, state-of the-art algorithms are shown to perform as good as, and sometimes even better than human annotations -- a fact masked by previous validations. The proposed framework also provides us an objective understanding of the gap between the present best and the best possible segmentation algorithm. We draw these conclusions based on an extensive evaluation of six segmentation strategies, including three most recent algorithms, vis-a-vis segmentations from three human annotators. The evaluation framework also gives insights about which segments should be necessarily detected by an algorithm for achieving the best retrieval results.

From there, it uses the MRF-Gibbs equivalence to derive joint probabilities as well as local probabilities for document variables.

The filtering of contents of the web pages holds greater significance in cases of access by minor-age people. The traditional web page blocking systems goes by the Boolean methodology of either displaying the full page or blocking it completely. With the increased dynamism in the web pages, it has become a common phenomenon that different portions of the web page holds different types of content at different time instances. This paper proposes a model to block the contents at a fine-grained level i.e. instead of completely blocking the page it would be efficient to block only those segments which holds the contents to be blocked. The advantages of this method over the traditional methods are fine-graining level of blocking and automatic identification of portions of the page to be blocked.

7074,Approximate Recall Confidence Intervals,"Recall, the proportion of relevant documents retrieved, is an important measure of effectiveness in information retrieval, particularly in the legal, patent, and medical domains. Where document sets are too large for exhaustive relevance assessment, recall can be estimated by assessing a random sample of documents; but an indication of the reliability of this estimate is also required. In this article, we examine several methods for estimating two-tailed recall confidence intervals. We find that the normal approximation in current use provides poor coverage in many circumstances, even when adjusted to correct its inappropriate symmetry. Analytic and Bayesian methods based on the ratio of binomials are generally more accurate, but are inaccurate on small populations. The method we recommend derives beta-binomial posteriors on retrieved and unretrieved yield, with fixed hyperparameters, and a Monte Carlo estimate of the posterior distribution of recall. We demonstrate that this method gives mean coverage at or near the nominal level, across several scenarios, while being balanced and stable. We offer advice on sampling design, including the allocation of assessments to the retrieved and unretrieved segments, and compare the proposed beta-binomial with the officially reported normal intervals for recent TREC Legal Track iterations.",Information Retrieval

7078,A new supervised non-linear mapping,"Supervised mapping methods project multi-dimensional labeled data onto a 2-dimensional space attempting to preserve both data similarities and topology of classes. Supervised mappings are expected to help the user to understand the underlying original class structure and to classify new data visually. Several methods have been designed to achieve supervised mapping, but many of them modify original distances prior to the mapping so that original data similarities are corrupted and even overlapping classes tend to be separated onto the map ignoring their original topology. We propose ClassiMap, an alternative method for supervised mapping. Mappings come with distortions which can be split between tears (close points mapped far apart) and false neighborhoods (points far apart mapped as neighbors). Some mapping methods favor the former while others favor the latter. ClassiMap switches between such mapping methods so that tears tend to appear between classes and false neighborhood within classes, better preserving classes' topology. We also propose two new objective criteria instead of the usual subjective visual inspection to perform fair comparisons of supervised mapping methods. ClassiMap appears to be the best supervised mapping method according to these criteria in our experiments on synthetic and real datasets.",Information Retrieval

With the mechanism of pheromone transmission between users and items, our method can pinpoint most relative users and items even in face of the sparsity problem. By virtue of the evaporation of existing pheromone, we capture the evolution of user preference over time. Meanwhile, the computation complexity is comparatively small and the incremental update can be done online.

7082,Hybrid Information Retrieval Model For Web Images,"The Bing Bang of the Internet in the early 90's increased dramatically the number of images being distributed and shared over the web. As a result, image information retrieval systems were developed to index and retrieve image files spread over the Internet. Most of these systems are keyword-based which search for images based on their textual metadata; and thus, they are imprecise as it is vague to describe an image with a human language. Besides, there exist the content-based image retrieval systems which search for images based on their visual information. However, content-based type systems are still immature and not that effective as they suffer from low retrieval recall/precision rate. This paper proposes a new hybrid image information retrieval model for indexing and retrieving web images published in HTML documents. The distinguishing mark of the proposed model is that it is based on both graphical content and textual metadata. The graphical content is denoted by color features and color histogram of the image; while textual metadata are denoted by the terms that surround the image in the HTML document, more particularly, the terms that appear in the tags p, h1, and h2, in addition to the terms that appear in the image's alt attribute, filename, and class-label. Moreover, this paper presents a new term weighting scheme called VTF-IDF short for Variable Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency which unlike traditional schemes, it exploits the HTML tag structure and assigns an extra bonus weight for terms that appear within certain particular HTML tags that are correlated to the semantics of the image. Experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed IR model showed a high retrieval precision rate that outpaced other current models.",Information Retrieval
7083,Semantic-Sensitive Web Information Retrieval Model for HTML Documents,"With the advent of the Internet, a new era of digital information exchange has begun. Currently, the Internet encompasses more than five billion online sites and this number is exponentially increasing every day. Fundamentally, Information Retrieval (IR) is the science and practice of storing documents and retrieving information from within these documents. Mathematically, IR systems are at the core based on a feature vector model coupled with a term weighting scheme that weights terms in a document according to their significance with respect to the context in which they appear. Practically, Vector Space Model (VSM), Term Frequency (TF), and Inverse Term Frequency (IDF) are among other long-established techniques employed in mainstream IR systems. However, present IR models only target generic-type text documents, in that, they do not consider specific formats of files such as HTML web documents. This paper proposes a new semantic-sensitive web information retrieval model for HTML documents. It consists of a vector model called SWVM and a weighting scheme called BTF-IDF, particularly designed to support the indexing and retrieval of HTML web documents. The chief advantage of the proposed model is that it assigns extra weights for terms that appear in certain pre-specified HTML tags that are correlated to the semantics of the document. Additionally, the model is semantic-sensitive as it generates synonyms for every term being indexed and later weights them appropriately to increase the likelihood of retrieving documents with similar context but different vocabulary terms. Experiments conducted, revealed a momentous enhancement in the precision of web IR systems and a radical increase in the number of relevant documents being retrieved. As further research, the proposed model is to be upgraded so as to support the indexing and retrieval of web images in multimedia-rich web documents.",Information Retrieval

  Segmentation",The World Wide Web caters to the needs of billions of users in heterogeneous groups. Each user accessing the World Wide Web might have his / her own specific interest and would expect the web to respond to the specific requirements. The process of making the web to react in a customized manner is achieved through personalization. This paper proposes a novel model for extracting keywords from a web page with personalization being incorporated into it. The keyword extraction problem is approached with the help of web page segmentation which facilitates in making the problem simpler and solving it effectively. The proposed model is implemented as a prototype and the experiments conducted on it empirically validate the model's efficiency.,Information Retrieval

Indeed, the performance of information retrieval systems in the Arabic language is still a problem. For this reason, we are interested in studying the performance of the most famous search engine, which is a Google Desktop, while searching in Arabic language documents. Then, we propose an update to the Google Desktop to take into consideration in search the Arabic words that have the same root. After that, we evaluate the performance of the Google Desktop in this context. Also, we are interested in evaluation the performance of peer-to-peer application in two ways. The first one uses a simple indexation that indexes Arabic documents without taking in consideration the root of words. The second way takes in consideration the roots in the indexation of Arabic documents. This evaluation is done by using a corpus of ten thousand documents and one hundred different queries.",Information Retrieval

In this context, effective information retrieval from the expanding web is a challenging task, in particular, if the query is ambiguous. The major question arises here is that how to get the relevant pages for an ambiguous query. We propose an approach for the effective result of an ambiguous query by forming community vector based on association concept of data minning using vector space model and the freedictionary. We develop clusters by computing the similarity between community vectors and document vectors formed from the extracted web pages by the search engine. We use Gensim package to implement the algorithm because of its simplicity and robust nature. Analysis shows that our approach is an effective way to form clusters for an ambiguous query.",Information Retrieval
7087,Extracting Geospatial Preferences Using Relational Neighbors,"With the increasing popularity of location-based social media applications and devices that automatically tag generated content with locations, large repositories of collaborative geo-referenced data are appearing on-line. Efficiently extracting user preferences from these data to determine what information to recommend is challenging because of the sheer volume of data as well as the frequency of updates. Traditional recommender systems focus on the interplay between users and items, but ignore contextual parameters such as location. In this paper we take a geospatial approach to determine locational preferences and similarities between users. We propose to capture the geographic context of user preferences for items using a relational graph, through which we are able to derive many new and state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms, including combinations of them, requiring changes only in the definition of the edge weights. Furthermore, we discuss several solutions for cold-start scenarios. Finally, we conduct experiments using two real-world datasets and provide empirical evidence that many of the proposed algorithms outperform existing location-aware recommender algorithms.",Information Retrieval

7089,Development of a Conceptual Structure for a Domain-Specific Corpus,"The corpus reported in this paper was developed for the evaluation of a domain-specific Text to Knowledge Mapping (TKM) prototype. The TKM prototype operates on the basis of both a combinatory categorical grammar (CCG) linguistic model and a knowledge model that consists of three layers: ontology, qualitative and quantitative layers. In the course of this evaluation it was necessary to populate these initial models with lexical items and semantic relations. Both elements, the lexicon and semantic relations, are meant to reflect the domain of the prototype; hence both had to be extracted from the corpus. While dealing with the lexicon was straight forward, the identification and extraction of appropriate semantic relations was much more involved. It was necessary, therefore, to manually develop a conceptual structure for the domain which was then used to formulate a domain-specific framework of semantic relations. The conceptual structure was developed using the Cmap tool of IHMC. The framework of semantic relations- that has resulted from this study consisted of 55 relations, out of which 42 have inverse relations.",Information Retrieval
7090,Event based classification of Web 2.0 text streams,"Web 2.0 applications like Twitter or Facebook create a continuous stream of information. This demands new ways of analysis in order to offer insight into this stream right at the moment of the creation of the information, because lots of this data is only relevant within a short period of time. To address this problem real time search engines have recently received increased attention. They take into account the continuous flow of information differently than traditional web search by incorporating temporal and social features, that describe the context of the information during its creation. Standard approaches where data first get stored and then is processed from a peristent storage suffer from latency. We want to address the fluent and rapid nature of text stream by providing an event based approach that analyses directly the stream of information. In a first step we want to define the difference between real time search and traditional search to clarify the demands in modern text filtering. In a second step we want to show how event based features can be used to support the tasks of real time search engines. Using the example of Twitter we present in this paper a way how to combine an event based approach with text mining and information filtering concepts in order to classify incoming information based on stream features. We calculate stream dependant features and feed them into a neural network in order to classify the text streams. We show the separative capabilities of event based features as the foundation for a real time search engine.",Information Retrieval
7091,TopSig: Topology Preserving Document Signatures,"Performance comparisons between File Signatures and Inverted Files for text retrieval have previously shown several significant shortcomings of file signatures relative to inverted files. The inverted file approach underpins most state-of-the-art search engine algorithms, such as Language and Probabilistic models. It has been widely accepted that traditional file signatures are inferior alternatives to inverted files. This paper describes TopSig, a new approach to the construction of file signatures. Many advances in semantic hashing and dimensionality reduction have been made in recent times, but these were not so far linked to general purpose, signature file based, search engines. This paper introduces a different signature file approach that builds upon and extends these recent advances. We are able to demonstrate significant improvements in the performance of signature file based indexing and retrieval, performance that is comparable to that of state of the art inverted file based systems, including Language models and BM25. These findings suggest that file signatures offer a viable alternative to inverted files in suitable settings and from the theoretical perspective it positions the file signatures model in the class of Vector Space retrieval models.",Information Retrieval
7092,Multi-Faceted Ranking of News Articles using Post-Read Actions,"Personalized article recommendation is important to improve user engagement on news sites. Existing work quantifies engagement primarily through click rates. We argue that quality of recommendations can be improved by incorporating different types of ""post-read"" engagement signals like sharing, commenting, printing and e-mailing article links. More specifically, we propose a multi-faceted ranking problem for recommending news articles where each facet corresponds to a ranking problem to maximize actions of a post-read action type. The key technical challenge is to estimate the rates of post-read action types by mitigating the impact of enormous data sparsity, we do so through several variations of factor models. To exploit correlations among post-read action types we also introduce a novel variant called locally augmented tensor (LAT) model. Through data obtained from a major news site in the US, we show that factor models significantly outperform a few baseline IR models and the LAT model significantly outperforms several other variations of factor models. Our findings show that it is possible to incorporate post-read signals that are commonly available on online news sites to improve quality of recommendations.",Information Retrieval

Hence, web services are very autonomous. Users view this autonomy as a major drawback because they need often to combine query capabilities of many web services at the same time. In this work, we will present a new approach which allows users to benefit of query capabilities of many web services while respecting autonomy of each service.

7098,A Theory of Information Matching,"In this work, we propose a theory for information matching. It is motivated by the observation that retrieval is about the relevance matching between two sets of properties (features), namely, the information need representation and information item representation. However, many probabilistic retrieval models rely on fixing one representation and optimizing the other (e.g. fixing the single information need and tuning the document) but not both. Therefore, it is difficult to use the available related information on both the document and the query at the same time in calculating the probability of relevance. In this paper, we address the problem by hypothesizing the relevance as a logical relationship between the two sets of properties; the relationship is defined on two separate mappings between these properties. By using the hypothesis we develop a unified probabilistic relevance model which is capable of using all the available information. We validate the proposed theory by formulating and developing probabilistic relevance ranking functions for both ad-hoc text retrieval and collaborative filtering. Our derivation in text retrieval illustrates the use of the theory in the situation where no relevance information is available. In collaborative filtering, we show that the resulting recommender model unifies the user and item information into a relevance ranking function without applying any dimensionality reduction techniques or computing explicit similarity between two different users (or items), in contrast to the state-of-the-art recommender models.",Information Retrieval
7099,Quantum contextuality in classical information retrieval,"Document ranking based on probabilistic evaluations of relevance is known to exhibit non-classical correlations, which may be explained by admitting a complex structure of the event space, namely, by assuming the events to emerge from multiple sample spaces.

In this Note I observe that from the structural point of view quantum contextuality looks similar to personalization of information retrieval scenarios. Along these lines, Knowledge Revision is treated as operationalistic measurement and a way to quantify the rate of personalization of Information Retrieval scenarios is suggested.",Information Retrieval

With the increasing number of cases infected with the coronavirus, it has become necessary to address this epidemic by all available means. Detection of the covid-19 is currently one of the world's most difficult challenges. Data science and machine learning (ML), for example, can aid in the battle against this pandemic. Furthermore, various research published in this direction proves that ML techniques can identify illness and viral infections more precisely, allowing patients' diseases to be detected at an earlier stage. In this paper, we will present how ontologies can aid in predicting the presence of covid-19 based on symptoms. The integration of ontology and ML is achieved by implementing rules of the decision tree algorithm into ontology reasoner. In addition, we compared the outcomes with various ML classifications used to make predictions. The findings are assessed using performance measures generated from the confusion matrix, such as F-measure, accuracy, precision, and recall. The ontology surpassed all ML algorithms with high accuracy value of 97.4%, according to the results.",Information Retrieval
7101,A Fuzzy Approach for Pertinent Information Extraction from Web Resources,"Recent work in machine learning for information extraction has focused on two distinct sub-problems: the conventional problem of filling template slots from natural language text, and the problem of wrapper induction, learning simple extraction procedures (""wrappers"") for highly structured text such as Web pages. For suitable regular domains, existing wrapper induction algorithms can efficiently learn wrappers that are simple and highly accurate, but the regularity bias of these algorithms makes them unsuitable for most conventional information extraction tasks. This paper describes a new approach for wrapping semistructured Web pages. The wrapper is capable of learning how to extract relevant information from Web resources on the basis of user supplied examples. It is based on inductive learning techniques as well as fuzzy logic rules. Experimental results show that our approach achieves noticeably better precision and recall coefficient performance measures than SoftMealy, which is one of the most recently reported wrappers capable of wrapping semi-structured Web pages with missing attributes, multiple attributes, variant attribute permutations, exceptions, and typos.",Information Retrieval

It is known that the use of a general Bayesian network methodology as the basis for an IR system is difficult to tackle. The problem mainly appears because of the large number of variables involved and the computational efforts needed to both determine the relationships between variables and perform the inference processes. To resolve these problems, many models have been proposed such as BNR model. Generally, Bayesian network models doesn't consider the fuzziness of natural language in the relevance measure of a document to a given query and possibilistic models doesn't undertake the dependence relations between terms used to index documents. As a first solution we propose a hybridization of these two models in one that will undertake both the relationship between terms and the intrinsic fuzziness of natural language. We believe that the translation of Bayesian network model from the probabilistic framework to possibilistic one will allow a performance improvement of BNRM.",Information Retrieval

The goal of such approaches is to define flexible Knowledge Extraction Systems able to deal with the inherent vagueness and uncertainty of the Extraction process. It has long been recognised that interactivity improves the effectiveness of Knowledge Extraction systems. Novice user's queries is the most natural and interactive medium of communication and recent progress in recognition is making it possible to build systems that interact with the user. However, given the typical novice user's queries submitted to Knowledge Extraction systems, it is easy to imagine that the effects of goal recognition errors in novice user's queries must be severely destructive on the system's effectiveness. The experimental work reported in this paper shows that the use of classical Knowledge Extraction techniques for novice user's query processing is robust to considerably high levels of goal recognition errors. Moreover, both standard relevance feedback and pseudo relevance feedback can be effectively employed to improve the effectiveness of novice user's query processing.",Information Retrieval

Its presence is increasingly important for the whole media industry due to the influence of the Web. For advertisers, it is a smarter alternative to traditional marketing media such as TVs and newspapers.

  Bayesian Formalism","This paper presents a method of optimization, based on both Bayesian Analysis technical and Galois Lattice of Fuzzy Semantic Network. The technical System we use learns by interpreting an unknown word using the links created between this new word and known words. The main link is provided by the context of the query. When novice's query is confused with an unknown verb (goal) applied to a known noun denoting either an object in the ideal user's Network or an object in the user's Network, the system infer that this new verb corresponds to one of the known goal. With the learning of new words in natural language as the interpretation, which was produced in agreement with the user, the system improves its representation scheme at each experiment with a new user and, in addition, takes advantage of previous discussions with users. The semantic Net of user objects thus obtained by learning is not always optimal because some relationships between couple of user objects can be generalized and others suppressed according to values of forces that characterize them. Indeed, to simplify the obtained Net, we propose to proceed to an Inductive Bayesian Analysis, on the Net obtained from Galois lattice. The objective of this analysis can be seen as an operation of filtering of the obtained descriptive graph.",Information Retrieval

The aim of this study was to get more insight into whether Web users manage to assess difficulty, time effort, query effort, and task outcome of search tasks, and if their judging performance relates to task complexity. Our study was conducted with a systematically selected sample of 56 people with a wide demographic background.

As a consequence, various kinds of algorithms have been proposed in last few years to improve the performance. However, all of them face one critical problem: data sparsity. In this paper, we proposed a two-step recommendation algorithm via iterative local least squares (ILLS). Firstly, we obtain the ratings matrix which is constructed via users' behavioral records, and it is normally very sparse. Secondly, we preprocess the ""ratings"" matrix through ProbS which can convert the sparse data to a dense one. Then we use ILLS to estimate those missing values. Finally, the recommendation list is generated. Experimental results on the three datasets: MovieLens, Netflix, RYM, suggest that the proposed method can enhance the algorithmic accuracy of AUC.

7118,Broccoli: Semantic Full-Text Search at your Fingertips,"We present Broccoli, a fast and easy-to-use search engine for what we call semantic full-text search. Semantic full-text search combines the capabilities of standard full-text search and ontology search. The search operates on four kinds of objects: ordinary words (e.g., edible), classes (e.g., plants), instances (e.g., Broccoli), and relations (e.g., occurs-with or native-to). Queries are trees, where nodes are arbitrary bags of these objects, and arcs are relations. The user interface guides the user in incrementally constructing such trees by instant (search-as-you-type) suggestions of words, classes, instances, or relations that lead to good hits. Both standard full-text search and pure ontology search are included as special cases. In this paper, we describe the query language of Broccoli, the main idea behind a new kind of index that enables fast processing of queries from that language as well as fast query suggestion, the natural language processing required, and the user interface. We evaluated query times and result quality on the full version of the English Wikipedia (40 GB XML dump) combined with the YAGO ontology (26 million facts).

  Meaning Words","Meaning of Web-page content plays a big role while produced a search result from a search engine. Most of the cases Web-page meaning stored in title or meta-tag area but those meanings do not always match with Web-page content. To overcome this situation we need to go through the Web-page content to identify the Web-page meaning. In such cases, where Webpage content holds dual meaning words that time it is really difficult to identify the meaning of the Web-page. In this paper, we are introducing a new design and development mechanism of identifying the Web-page content meaning which holds dual meaning words in their Web-page content.",Information Retrieval
7121,Semantic Information Retrieval Using Ontology In University Domain,"Today's conventional search engines hardly do provide the essential content relevant to the user's search query. This is because the context and semantics of the request made by the user is not analyzed to the full extent. So here the need for a semantic web search arises. SWS is upcoming in the area of web search which combines Natural Language Processing and Artificial Intelligence. The objective of the work done here is to design, develop and implement a semantic search engine- SIEU(Semantic Information Extraction in University Domain) confined to the university domain. SIEU uses ontology as a knowledge base for the information retrieval process. It is not just a mere keyword search. It is one layer above what Google or any other search engines retrieve by analyzing just the keywords. Here the query is analyzed both syntactically and semantically. The developed system retrieves the web results more relevant to the user query through keyword expansion. The results obtained here will be accurate enough to satisfy the request made by the user. The level of accuracy will be enhanced since the query is analyzed semantically. The system will be of great use to the developers and researchers who work on web. The Google results are re-ranked and optimized for providing the relevant links. For ranking an algorithm has been applied which fetches more apt results for the user query.",Information Retrieval

While these ranking signals implicitly consider credibility (e.g., by measuring popularity), explicit measures of credibility are not applied. In this chapter, credibility in Web search engines is discussed in a broad context: credibility as a measure for including documents in a search engine's index, credibility as a ranking signal, credibility in the context of universal search results, and the possibility of using credibility as an explicit measure for ranking purposes. It is found that while search engines-at least to a certain extent-show credible results to their users, there is no fully integrated credibility framework for Web search engines.",Information Retrieval
7123,Semantic Web Techniques for Yellow Page Service Providers,"Use of web pages providing unstructured information poses variety of problems to the user, such as use of arbitrary formats, unsuitability for machine processing and likely incompleteness of information. Structured data alleviates these problems but we require more. Very often yellow page systems are implemented using a centralized database. In some cases, human intermediaries accessible over the phone network examine a centralized database and use their reasoning ability to deal with the user's need for information. Scaling up such systems is difficult. This paper explores an alternative - a highly distributed system design meeting a variety of needs - considerably reducing efforts required at a central organization, enabling large numbers of vendors to enter information about their own products and services, enabling end-users to contribute information such as their own ratings, using an ontology to describe each domain of application in a flexible manner for uses foreseen and unforeseen, enabling distributed search and mash-ups, use of vendor independent standards, using reasoning to find the best matches to a given query, geo-spatial reasoning and a simple, interactive, mobile application/interface. We give importance to geo-spatial information and mobile applications because of the very wide-spread use of mobile phones and their inherent ability to provide some information about the current location of the user. We have created a prototype using the Jena Toolkit and geo-spatial extensions to SPARQL. We have tested this prototype by asking a group of typical users to use it and to provide structured feedback. We have summarized this feedback in the paper. We believe that the technology can be applied in many contexts in addition to yellow page systems.",Information Retrieval

Different Page Rank based algorithms like Page Rank (PR), WPR (Weighted Page Rank), HITS (Hyperlink Induced Topic Selection), Distance Rank and EigenRumor algorithms are discussed and compared.

  Annotations","The evaluation of web pages against a query is the pivot around which the Information Retrieval domain revolves around. The context sensitive, semantic evaluation of web pages is a non-trivial problem which needs to be addressed immediately. This research work proposes a model to evaluate the web pages by cumulating the segment scores which are computed by multidimensional evaluation methodology. The model proposed is hybrid since it utilizes both the structural semantics and content semantics in the evaluation process. The score of the web page is computed in a bottom-up process by evaluating individual segment's score through a multi-dimensional approach. The model incorporates an approach for segment level annotation. The proposed model is prototyped for evaluation; experiments conducted on the prototype confirm the model's efficiency in semantic evaluation of pages.",Information Retrieval
7126,"Graphical Query Builder in Opportunistic Sensor Networks to discover
  Sensor Information","A lot of sensor network applications are data-driven. We believe that query is the most preferred way to discover sensor services. Normally users are unaware of available sensors. Thus users need to pose different types of query over the sensor network to get the desired information. Even users may need to input more complicated queries with higher levels of aggregations, and requires more complex interactions with the system. As the users have no prior knowledge of the sensor data or services our aim is to develop a visual query interface where users can feed more user friendly queries and machine can understand those. In this paper work, we have developed an Interactive visual query interface for the users. To accomplish this we have considered several use cases and we have derived graphical representation of query from their text based format for those use case scenario. We have facilitated the user by extracting class, subclass and properties from Ontology. To do so we have parsed OWL file in the user interface and based upon the parsed information users build visual query. Later on we have translated the visual query languages into SPARQL query, a machine understandable format which helps the machine to communicate with the underlying technology.",Information Retrieval

The most prominent issues that arose from pretests with this test collection were the very unspecific topics and sparse document representations. Only half of the topics (26/50) contained a description and the titles were usually short with just around two words. Therefore we focused on three different term suggestion and query expansion mechanisms to surpass the sparse topical description. We used two methods that build on concept extraction from Wikipedia and on a method that applied co-occurrence statistics on the available Europeana corpus. In the following paper we will present the approaches and preliminary results from their assessments.",Information Retrieval

In addition, feature subspace is extracted and updated during the feedback process using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique and based on user's feedback. That is, in addition to reducing the dimensionality of feature spaces, a proper subspace for each type of features is obtained in the feedback process to further improve the retrieval accuracy. Experiments show that using relevance Feedback in DIR achieves better performance than common DIR.",Information Retrieval

Information retrieval is concerned with the structure, analysis, organization, storage, searching, and retrieval of information. Index is the main constituent of an IR system. Now a day exponential growth of information makes the index structure large enough affecting the IR system's quality. So compressing the Index structure is our main contribution in this paper. We compressed the document number in inverted file entries using a new coding technique based on run-length encoding. Our coding mechanism uses a specified code which acts over run-length coding. We experimented and found that our coding mechanism on an average compresses 67.34% percent more than the other techniques.",Information Retrieval

So in this paper I have discussed that how information is retrieved from the web and the efforts required for retrieving this information in terms of system and users efforts.,Information Retrieval
7133,Discovering and Leveraging the Most Valuable Links for Ranking,"On the Web, visits of a page are often introduced by one or more valuable linking sources. Indeed, good back links are valuable resources for Web pages and sites. We propose to discovering and leveraging the best backlinks of pages for ranking. Similar to PageRank, MaxRank scores are updated {recursively}. In particular, with probability $\lambda$, the MaxRank of a document is updated from the backlink source with the maximum score; with probability $1-\lambda$, the MaxRank of a document is updated from a random backlink source. MaxRank has an interesting relation to PageRank. When $\lambda=0$, MaxRank reduces to PageRank; when $\lambda=1$, MaxRank only looks at the best backlink it thinks. Empirical results on Wikipedia shows that the global authorities are very influential; Overall large $\lambda$s (but smaller than 1) perform best: the convergence is dramatically faster than PageRank, but the performance is still comparable. We study the influence of these sources and propose a few measures such as the times of being the best backlink for others, and related properties of the proposed algorithm. The introduction of best backlink sources provides new insights for link analysis. Besides ranking, our method can be used to discover the most valuable linking sources for a page or Website, which is useful for both search engines and site owners.",Information Retrieval
7134,Using the DOM Tree for Content Extraction,"The main information of a webpage is usually mixed between menus, advertisements, panels, and other not necessarily related information; and it is often difficult to automatically isolate this information. This is precisely the objective of content extraction, a research area of widely interest due to its many applications. Content extraction is useful not only for the final human user, but it is also frequently used as a preprocessing stage of different systems that need to extract the main content in a web document to avoid the treatment and processing of other useless information. Other interesting application where content extraction is particularly used is displaying webpages in small screens such as mobile phones or PDAs. In this work we present a new technique for content extraction that uses the DOM tree of the webpage to analyze the hierarchical relations of the elements in the webpage. Thanks to this information, the technique achieves a considerable recall and precision. Using the DOM structure for content extraction gives us the benefits of other approaches based on the syntax of the webpage (such as characters, words and tags), but it also gives us a very precise information regarding the related components in a block, thus, producing very cohesive blocks.",Information Retrieval

With this much amount of information available, it is not possible to take the full advantage of the World Wide Web without having a proper framework to search through the available data. This requisite organization can be done in many ways. In this paper we introduce a combine approach to cluster the web pages which first finds the frequent sets and then clusters the documents. These frequent sets are generated by using Frequent Pattern growth technique. Then by applying Fuzzy C- Means algorithm on it, we found clusters having documents which are highly related and have similar features. We used Gensim package to implement our approach because of its simplicity and robust nature. We have compared our results with the combine approach of (Frequent Pattern growth, K-means) and (Frequent Pattern growth, Cosine_Similarity). Experimental results show that our approach is more efficient then the above two combine approach and can handles more efficiently the serious limitation of traditional Fuzzy C-Means algorithm, which is sensitiveto initial centroid and the number of clusters to be formed.",Information Retrieval

At present, the process is mostly manual, but some traditional technologies such as keyword searching are commonly used to speed the process up. But a keyword search is not a comprehensive search to cater to the requirements of legal research as the search result includes too many false hits in terms of irrelevant case records. Hence the present generic tools cannot be used to automate legal research.

Further, the research also identifies the possible enhancements that could be done to enhance the effectiveness of the framework.",Information Retrieval

7139,A semantic association page rank algorithm for web search engines,"The majority of Semantic Web search engines retrieve information by focusing on the use of concepts and relations restricted to the query provided by the user. By trying to guess the implicit meaning between these concepts and relations, probabilities are calculated to give the pages a score for ranking. In this study, I propose a relation-based page rank algorithm to be used as a Semantic Web search engine. Relevance is measured as the probability of finding the connections made by the user at the time of the query, as well as the information contained in the base knowledge of the Semantic Web environment. By the use of ""virtual links"" between the concepts in a page, which are obtained from the knowledge base, we can connect concepts and components of a page and increase the probability score for a better ranking. By creating these connections, this study also looks to eliminate the possibility of getting results equal to zero, and to provide a tie-breaker solution when two or more pages obtain the same score.",Information Retrieval

7141,"Collaborative Competitive filtering II: Optimal Recommendation and
  Collaborative Games","Recommender systems have emerged as a new weapon to help online firms to realize many of their strategic goals (e.g., to improve sales, revenue, customer experience etc.). However, many existing techniques commonly approach these goals by seeking to recover preference (e.g., estimating ratings) in a matrix completion framework. This paper aims to bridge this significant gap between the clearly-defined strategic objectives and the not-so-well-justified proxy.   We show it is advantageous to think of a recommender system as an analogy to a monopoly economic market with the system as the sole seller, users as the buyers and items as the goods. This new perspective motivates a game-theoretic formulation for recommendation that enables us to identify the optimal recommendation policy by explicit optimizing certain strategic goals. In this paper, we revisit and extend our prior work, the Collaborative-Competitive Filtering preference model, towards a game-theoretic framework. The proposed framework consists of two components. First, a conditional preference model that characterizes how a user would respond to a recommendation action; Second, knowing in advance how the user would respond, how a recommender system should act (i.e., recommend) strategically to maximize its goals. We show how objectives such as click-through rate, sales revenue and consumption diversity can be optimized explicitly in this framework. Experiments are conducted on a commercial recommender system and demonstrate promising results.",Information Retrieval
7142,Preference-based Graphic Models for Collaborative Filtering,"Collaborative filtering is a very useful general technique for exploiting the preference patterns of a group of users to predict the utility of items to a particular user. Previous research has studied several probabilistic graphic models for collaborative filtering with promising results. However, while these models have succeeded in capturing the similarity among users and items in one way or the other, none of them has considered the fact that users with similar interests in items can have very different rating patterns; some users tend to assign a higher rating to all items than other users. In this paper, we propose and study of two new graphic models that address the distinction between user preferences and ratings. In one model, called the decoupled model, we introduce two different variables to decouple a users preferences FROM his ratings. IN the other, called the preference model, we model the orderings OF items preferred BY a USER, rather than the USERs numerical ratings of items. Empirical study over two datasets of movie ratings shows that appropriate modeling of the distinction between user preferences and ratings improves the performance substantially and consistently. Specifically, the proposed decoupled model outperforms all five existing approaches that we compare with significantly, but the preference model is not very successful. These results suggest that explicit modeling of the underlying user preferences is very important for collaborative filtering, but we can not afford ignoring the rating information completely.",Information Retrieval

Indeed, the huge number of information on the web as well as the growth of new inexperienced users creates new challenges for information retrieval; certainly the current search engines (such as Google, Bing and Yahoo) offer an efficient way to browse the web content. However, this type of tool does not take into account the semantic driven by the query terms and document words. This paper proposes a new semantic based approach for the evaluation of information retrieval systems; the goal is to increase the selectivity of search tools and to improve how these tools are evaluated. The test of the proposed approach for the evaluation of search engines has proved its applicability to real search tools.

  De-Duplication in Streams","Applications involving telecommunication call data records, web pages, online transactions, medical records, stock markets, climate warning systems, etc., necessitate efficient management and processing of such massively exponential amount of data from diverse sources. De-duplication or Intelligent Compression in streaming scenarios for approximate identification and elimination of duplicates from such unbounded data stream is a greater challenge given the real-time nature of data arrival. Stable Bloom Filters (SBF) addresses this problem to a certain extent. .   In this work, we present several novel algorithms for the problem of approximate detection of duplicates in data streams. We propose the Reservoir Sampling based Bloom Filter (RSBF) combining the working principle of reservoir sampling and Bloom Filters. We also present variants of the novel Biased Sampling based Bloom Filter (BSBF) based on biased sampling concepts. We also propose a randomized load balanced variant of the sampling Bloom Filter approach to efficiently tackle the duplicate detection. In this work, we thus provide a generic framework for de-duplication using Bloom Filters. Using detailed theoretical analysis we prove analytical bounds on the false positive rate, false negative rate and convergence rate of the proposed structures. We exhibit that our models clearly outperform the existing methods. We also demonstrate empirical analysis of the structures using real-world datasets (3 million records) and also with synthetic datasets (1 billion records) capturing various input distributions.",Information Retrieval

However, the issue on thread search is how to combine evidence from text units(messages) to estimate thread relevance. In this paper, we first rank a list of messages, then we score threads by aggregating their ranked messages' scores. To aggregate the message scores, we adopt several voting techniques that have been applied in ranking aggregates tasks such as blog distillation and expert finding. The experimental result shows that many voting techniques should be preferred over a baseline that treats a thread as a concatenation of its message texts.",Information Retrieval

Discounted Cumulated Gains (DCG) has emerged as one of the evaluation metrics widely adopted for evaluating the performance of ranking functions used in Web search. However, the two sets of parameters, gain values and discount factors, used in DCG are determined in a rather ad-hoc way. In this paper we first show that DCG is generally not coherent, meaning that comparing the performance of ranking functions using DCG very much depends on the particular gain values and discount factors used. We then propose a novel methodology that can learn the gain values and discount factors from user preferences over rankings. Numerical simulations illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. Please contact the authors for the full version of this work.",Information Retrieval
7151,Learning Joint Query Interpretation and Response Ranking,"Thanks to information extraction and semantic Web efforts, search on unstructured text is increasingly refined using semantic annotations and structured knowledge bases. However, most users cannot become familiar with the schema of knowledge bases and ask structured queries. Interpreting free-format queries into a more structured representation is of much current interest. The dominant paradigm is to segment or partition query tokens by purpose (references to types, entities, attribute names, attribute values, relations) and then launch the interpreted query on structured knowledge bases. Given that structured knowledge extraction is never complete, here we use a data representation that retains the unstructured text corpus, along with structured annotations (mentions of entities and relationships) on it. We propose two new, natural formulations for joint query interpretation and response ranking that exploit bidirectional flow of information between the knowledge base and the corpus.One, inspired by probabilistic language models, computes expected response scores over the uncertainties of query interpretation. The other is based on max-margin discriminative learning, with latent variables representing those uncertainties. In the context of typed entity search, both formulations bridge a considerable part of the accuracy gap between a generic query that does not constrain the type at all, and the upper bound where the ""perfect"" target entity type of each query is provided by humans. Our formulations are also superior to a two-stage approach of first choosing a target type using recent query type prediction techniques, and then launching a type-restricted entity search query.",Information Retrieval
7152,"Collaborative Filtering by Personality Diagnosis: A Hybrid Memory- and
  Model-Based Approach","The growth of Internet commerce has stimulated the use of collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms as recommender systems. Such systems leverage knowledge about the known preferences of multiple users to recommend items of interest to other users. CF methods have been harnessed to make recommendations about such items as web pages, movies, books, and toys. Researchers have proposed and evaluated many approaches for generating recommendations. We describe and evaluate a new method called emph{personality diagnosis (PD)}. Given a user's preferences for some items, we compute the probability that he or she is of the same ""personality type"" as other users, and, in turn, the probability that he or she will like new items. PD retains some of the advantages of traditional similarity-weighting techniques in that all data is brought to bear on each prediction and new data can be added easily and incrementally. Additionally, PD has a meaningful probabilistic interpretation, which may be leveraged to justify, explain, and augment results. We report empirical results on the EachMovie database of movie ratings, and on user profile data collected from the CiteSeer digital library of Computer Science research papers.

  A Hidden Markov Model Approach","Information seeking process is an important topic in information seeking behavior research. Both qualitative and empirical methods have been adopted in analyzing information seeking processes, with major focus on uncovering the latent search tactics behind user behaviors. Most of the existing works require defining search tactics in advance and coding data manually. Among the few works that can recognize search tactics automatically, they missed making sense of those tactics. In this paper, we proposed using an automatic technique, i.e. the Hidden Markov Model (HMM), to explicitly model the search tactics. HMM results show that the identified search tactics of individual information seeking behaviors are consistent with Marchioninis Information seeking process model. With the advantages of showing the connections between search tactics and search actions and the transitions among search tactics, we argue that HMM is a useful tool to investigate information seeking process, or at least it provides a feasible way to analyze large scale dataset.",Information Retrieval
7154,Automatic Structuring Of Semantic Web Services An Approach,"Ontologies have become the effective modeling for various applications and significantly in the semantic web. The difficulty of extracting information from the web, which was created mainly for visualising information, has driven the birth of the semantic web, which will contain much more resources than the web and will attach machine-readable semantic information to these resources. Ontological bootstrapping on a set of predefined sources, such as web services, must address the problem of multiple, largely unrelated concepts. The web services consist of basically two components, Web Services Description Language (WSDL) descriptors and free text descriptors. The WSDL descriptor is evaluated using two methods, namely Term Frequency/Inverse Document Frequency (TF/IDF) and web context generation. The proposed bootstrapping ontological process integrates TF/IDF and web context generation and applies validation using the free text descriptor service, so that, it offers more accurate definition of ontologies. This paper uses ranking adaption model which predicts the rank for a collection of web service documents which leads to the automatic construction, enrichment and adaptation of ontologies.",Information Retrieval

It presents the traditional representation of web services considering traditional textual descriptions based on the information contained in WSDL files. Unfortunately, textual web services descriptions are dirty and need significant cleaning to keep only useful information. To deal with this problem, we introduce rules based text tagging method, which allows filtering web service description to keep only significant information. A new representation based on such filtered data is then introduced. Many web services have empty descriptions. Also, we consider web services representations based on the WSDL file structure (types, attributes, etc.). Alternatively, we introduce a new representation called symbolic reputation, which is computed from relationships between web services. The impact of the use of these representations on web service discovery and recommendation is studied and discussed in the experimentation using real world web services.",Information Retrieval

7159,Privacy Preserving Recommendation System Based on Groups,"Recommendation systems have received considerable attention in the recent decades. Yet with the development of information technology and social media, the risk in revealing private data to service providers has been a growing concern to more and more users. Trade-offs between quality and privacy in recommendation systems naturally arise. In this paper, we present a privacy preserving recommendation framework based on groups. The main idea is to use groups as a natural middleware to preserve users' privacy. A distributed preference exchange algorithm is proposed to ensure the anonymity of data, wherein the effective size of the anonymity set asymptotically approaches the group size with time. We construct a hybrid collaborative filtering model based on Markov random walks to provide recommendations and predictions to group members. Experimental results on the MovieLens and Epinions datasets show that our proposed methods outperform the baseline methods, L+ and ItemRank, two state-of-the-art personalized recommendation algorithms, for both recommendation precision and hit rate despite the absence of personal preference information.",Information Retrieval
7160,Intelligent Agent Based Semantic Web in Cloud Computing Environment,"Considering today's web scenario, there is a need of effective and meaningful search over the web which is provided by Semantic Web. Existing search engines are keyword based. They are vulnerable in answering intelligent queries from the user due to the dependence of their results on information available in web pages. While semantic search engines provides efficient and relevant results as the semantic web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well defined meaning. MetaCrawler is a search tool that uses several existing search engines and provides combined results by using their own page ranking algorithm. This paper proposes development of a meta-semantic-search engine called SemanTelli which works within cloud. SemanTelli fetches results from different semantic search engines such as Hakia, DuckDuckGo, SenseBot with the help of intelligent agents that eliminate the limitations of existing search engines.",Information Retrieval

Researchers have addressed the cold-start problem where either the user or the item is new. However, the situation with both new user and new item has seldom been considered. In this paper, we propose a cold-start recommendation approach to this situation based on granular association rules. Specifically, we provide a means for describing users and items through information granules, a means for generating association rules between users and items, and a means for recommending items to users using these rules. Experiments are undertaken on a publicly available dataset MovieLens. Results indicate that rule sets perform similarly on the training and the testing sets, and the appropriate setting of granule is essential to the application of granular association rules.",Information Retrieval

7166,"Using Exclusive Web Crawlers to Store Better Results in Search Engines'
  Database","Crawler-based search engines are the mostly used search engines among web and Internet users, involve web crawling, storing in database, ranking, indexing and displaying to the user. But it is noteworthy that because of increasing changes in web sites search engines suffer high time and transfers costs which are consumed to investigate the existence of each page in database while crawling, updating database and even investigating its existence in any crawling operations. ""Exclusive Web Crawler"" proposes guidelines for crawling features, links, media and other elements and to store crawling results in a certain table in its database on the web. With doing this, search engines store each site's tables in their databases and implement their ranking results on them. Thus, accuracy of data in every table (and its being up-to-date) is ensured and no 404 result is shown in search results since, in fact, this data crawler crawls data entered by webmaster and the database stores whatever he wants to display.",Information Retrieval
7167,Clustering Web Search Results For Effective Arabic Language Browsing,"The process of browsing Search Results is one of the major problems with traditional Web search engines for English, European, and any other languages generally, and for Arabic Language particularly. This process is absolutely time consuming and the browsing style seems to be unattractive. Organizing Web search results into clusters facilitates users quick browsing through search results. Traditional clustering techniques (data-centric clustering algorithms) are inadequate since they don't generate clusters with highly readable names or cluster labels. To solve this problem, Description-centric algorithms such as Suffix Tree Clustering (STC) algorithm have been introduced and used successfully and extensively with different adapted versions for English, European, and Chinese Languages. However, till the day of writing this paper, in our knowledge, STC algorithm has been never applied for Arabic Web Snippets Search Results Clustering.In this paper, we propose first, to study how STC can be applied for Arabic Language? We then illustrate by example that is impossible to apply STC after Arabic Snippets pre-processing (stem or root extraction) because the Merging process yields many redundant clusters. Secondly, to overcome this problem, we propose to integrate STC in a new scheme taking into a count the Arabic language properties in order to get the web more and more adapted to Arabic users. The proposed approach automatically clusters the web search results into high quality, and high significant clusters labels. The obtained clusters not only are coherent, but also can convey the contents to the users concisely and accurately. Therefore the Arabic users can decide at a glance whether the contents of a cluster are of interest.....",Information Retrieval

Recently, granular association rules have been proposed for cold-start recommendation. However, existing approaches reserve only globally strong rules; therefore some users may receive no recommendation at all. In this paper, we propose to mine the top-k granular association rules for each user. First we define three measures of granular association rules. These are the source coverage which measures the user granule size, the target coverage which measures the item granule size, and the confidence which measures the strength of the association. With the confidence measure, rules can be ranked according to their strength. Then we propose algorithms for training the recommender and suggesting items to each user. Experimental are undertaken on a publicly available data set MovieLens. Results indicate that the appropriate setting of granule can avoid over-fitting and at the same time, help obtaining high recommending accuracy.",Information Retrieval
7170,"Nouvelle approche de recommandation personnalisee dans les folksonomies
  basee sur le profil des utilisateurs","In folksonomies, users use to share objects (movies, books, bookmarks, etc.) by annotating them with a set of tags of their own choice. With the rise of the Web 2.0 age, users become the core of the system since they are both the contributors and the creators of the information. Yet, each user has its own profile and its own ideas making thereby the strength as well as the weakness of folksonomies. Indeed, it would be helpful to take account of users' profile when suggesting a list of tags and resources or even a list of friends, in order to make a personal recommandation, instead of suggesting the more used tags and resources in the folksonomy. In this paper, we consider users' profile as a new dimension of a folksonomy classically composed of three dimensions <users, tags, ressources> and we propose an approach to group users with equivalent profiles and equivalent interests as quadratic concepts. Then, we use such structures to propose our personalized recommendation system of users, tags and resources according to each user's profile.

We present ArcLink, a proof-of-concept system that complements open source Wayback Machine installations by optimizing the construction, storage, and access to the temporal web graph. We divide the web graph construction into four stages (filtering, extraction, storage, and access) and explore optimization for each stage.

In this context we are mainly interested in the local analysis technique for the ARF in ad-hoc IRS on Arabic documents. In this article, we have examined the impact of the variation of the two parameters implied in this technique, that is to say, the number of the documents {\guillemotleft}D{\guillemotright} and the number of terms {\guillemotleft}T{\guillemotright}, on an Arabic IRS performance. The experimentation, carried out on an Arabic corpus text, enables us to deduce that there are queries which are not easily improvable with the query reformulation. In addition, the success of the ARF is due mainly to the selection of a sufficient number of documents D and to the extraction of a very reduced set of relevant terms T for retrieval.",Information Retrieval

As it becomes easier to publish documents, as the number of users, and thus publishers, increases and as the number of documents grows, searching for information is turning into a cumbersome and time-consuming operation.

The main uses of web content mining are to gather, categorize, organize and provide the best possible information available on the Web to the user requesting the information. The mining tools are imperative to scanning the many HTML documents, images, and text. Then, the result is used by the search engines.

7179,Future Web Growth and its Consequences for Web Search Architectures,"Introduction: Before embarking on the design of any computer system it is first necessary to assess the magnitude of the problem. In the case of a web search engine this assessment amounts to determining the current size of the web, the growth rate of the web, and the quantity of computing resource necessary to search it, and projecting the historical growth of this into the future. Method: The over 20 year history of the web makes it possible to make short-term projections on future growth. The longer history of hard disk drives (and smart phone memory card) makes it possible to make short-term hardware projections. Analysis: Historical data on Internet uptake and hardware growth is extrapolated. Results: It is predicted that within a decade the storage capacity of a single hard drive will exceed the size of the index of the web at that time. Within another decade it will be possible to store the entire searchable text on the same hard drive. Within another decade the entire searchable web (including images) will also fit. Conclusion: This result raises questions about the future architecture of search engines. Several new models are proposed. In one model the user's computer is an active part of the distributed search architecture. They search a pre-loaded snapshot (back-file) of the web on their local device which frees up the online data centre for searching just the difference between the snapshot and the current time. Advantageously this also makes it possible to search when the user is disconnected from the Internet. In another model all changes to all files are broadcast to all users (forming a star-like network) and no data centre is needed.",Information Retrieval
7180,Graph-based Approach to Automatic Taxonomy Generation (GraBTax),"We propose a novel graph-based approach for constructing concept hierarchy from a large text corpus. Our algorithm, GraBTax, incorporates both statistical co-occurrences and lexical similarity in optimizing the structure of the taxonomy. To automatically generate topic-dependent taxonomies from a large text corpus, GraBTax first extracts topical terms and their relationships from the corpus. The algorithm then constructs a weighted graph representing topics and their associations. A graph partitioning algorithm is then used to recursively partition the topic graph into a taxonomy. For evaluation, we apply GraBTax to articles, primarily computer science, in the CiteSeerX digital library and search engine. The quality of the resulting concept hierarchy is assessed by both human judges and comparison with Wikipedia categories.",Information Retrieval

  Novel Algorithm","We present a supervised learning algorithm for text categorization which has brought the team of authors the 2nd place in the text categorization division of the 2012 Cybersecurity Data Mining Competition (CDMC'2012) and a 3rd prize overall. The algorithm is quite different from existing approaches in that it is based on similarity search in the metric space of measure distributions on the dictionary. At the preprocessing stage, given a labeled learning sample of texts, we associate to every class label (document category) a point in the space of question. Unlike it is usual in clustering, this point is not a centroid of the category but rather an outlier, a uniform measure distribution on a selection of domain-specific words. At the execution stage, an unlabeled text is assigned a text category as defined by the closest labeled neighbour to the point representing the frequency distribution of the words in the text. The algorithm is both effective and efficient, as further confirmed by experiments on the Reuters 21578 dataset.",Information Retrieval
7182,Sequential Selection of Correlated Ads by POMDPs,"Online advertising has become a key source of revenue for both web search engines and online publishers. For them, the ability of allocating right ads to right webpages is critical because any mismatched ads would not only harm web users' satisfactions but also lower the ad income. In this paper, we study how online publishers could optimally select ads to maximize their ad incomes over time. The conventional offline, content-based matching between webpages and ads is a fine start but cannot solve the problem completely because good matching does not necessarily lead to good payoff. Moreover, with the limited display impressions, we need to balance the need of selecting ads to learn true ad payoffs (exploration) with that of allocating ads to generate high immediate payoffs based on the current belief (exploitation). In this paper, we address the problem by employing Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) and discuss how to utilize the correlation of ads to improve the efficiency of the exploration and increase ad incomes in a long run. Our mathematical derivation shows that the belief states of correlated ads can be naturally updated using a formula similar to collaborative filtering. To test our model, a real world ad dataset from a major search engine is collected and categorized. Experimenting over the data, we provide an analyse of the effect of the underlying parameters, and demonstrate that our algorithms significantly outperform other strong baselines.",Information Retrieval

As the web contents have been removed, it is critical to make sure the displayed ads are directly related to the intents of the visitors who have been directed to the parked domains. Because of the missing contents in these domains, it is non-trivial to generate the keywords to describe the previous contents and therefore the users intents. In this paper we discuss the adaptive keywords extraction problem and introduce an algorithm based on the BM25F term weighting and linear multi-armed bandits. We built a prototype over a production domain registration system and evaluated it using crowdsourcing in multiple iterations. The prototype is compared with other popular methods and is shown to be more effective.",Information Retrieval
7184,GAPfm: Optimal Top-N Recommendations for Graded Relevance Domains,"Recommender systems are frequently used in domains in which users express their preferences in the form of graded judgments, such as ratings. If accurate top-N recommendation lists are to be produced for such graded relevance domains, it is critical to generate a ranked list of recommended items directly rather than predicting ratings. Current techniques choose one of two sub-optimal approaches: either they optimize for a binary metric such as Average Precision, which discards information on relevance grades, or they optimize for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), which ignores the dependence of an item's contribution on the relevance of more highly ranked items.   In this paper, we address the shortcomings of existing approaches by proposing the Graded Average Precision factor model (GAPfm), a latent factor model that is particularly suited to the problem of top-N recommendation in domains with graded relevance data. The model optimizes for Graded Average Precision, a metric that has been proposed recently for assessing the quality of ranked results list for graded relevance. GAPfm learns a latent factor model by directly optimizing a smoothed approximation of GAP. GAPfm's advantages are twofold: it maintains full information about graded relevance and also addresses the limitations of models that optimize NDCG. Experimental results show that GAPfm achieves substantial improvements on the top-N recommendation task, compared to several state-of-the-art approaches. In order to ensure that GAPfm is able to scale to very large data sets, we propose a fast learning algorithm that uses an adaptive item selection strategy. A final experiment shows that GAPfm is useful not only for generating recommendation lists, but also for ranking a given list of rated items.",Information Retrieval
7185,"Reading the Correct History? Modeling Temporal Intention in Resource
  Sharing","The web is trapped in the ""perpetual now"", and when users traverse from page to page, they are seeing the state of the web resource (i.e., the page) as it exists at the time of the click and not necessarily at the time when the link was made. Thus, a temporal discrepancy can arise between the resource at the time the page author created a link to it and the time when a reader follows the link. This is especially important in the context of social media: the ease of sharing links in a tweet or Facebook post allows many people to author web content, but the space constraints combined with poor awareness by authors often prevents sufficient context from being generated to determine the intent of the post. If the links are clicked as soon as they are shared, the temporal distance between sharing and clicking is so small that there is little to no difference in content. However, not all clicks occur immediately, and a delay of days or even hours can result in reading something other than what the author intended. We introduce the concept of a user's temporal intention upon publishing a link in social media. We investigate the features that could be extracted from the post, the linked resource, and the patterns of social dissemination to model this user intention. Finally, we analyze the historical integrity of the shared resources in social media across time. In other words, how much is the knowledge of the author's intent beneficial in maintaining the consistency of the story being told through social posts and in enriching the archived content coverage and depth of vulnerable resources?",Information Retrieval
7186,Timely crawling of high-quality ephemeral new content,"Nowadays, more and more people use the Web as their primary source of up-to-date information. In this context, fast crawling and indexing of newly created Web pages has become crucial for search engines, especially because user traffic to a significant fraction of these new pages (like news, blog and forum posts) grows really quickly right after they appear, but lasts only for several days.   In this paper, we study the problem of timely finding and crawling of such ephemeral new pages (in terms of user interest). Traditional crawling policies do not give any particular priority to such pages and may thus crawl them not quickly enough, and even crawl already obsolete content. We thus propose a new metric, well thought out for this task, which takes into account the decrease of user interest for ephemeral pages over time.   We show that most ephemeral new pages can be found at a relatively small set of content sources and present a procedure for finding such a set. Our idea is to periodically recrawl content sources and crawl newly created pages linked from them, focusing on high-quality (in terms of user interest) content. One of the main difficulties here is to divide resources between these two activities in an efficient way. We find the adaptive balance between crawls and recrawls by maximizing the proposed metric. Further, we incorporate search engine click logs to give our crawler an insight about the current user demands. Efficiency of our approach is finally demonstrated experimentally on real-world data.",Information Retrieval

In this paper, we propose to do tag refinement from the angle of topic modeling and present a novel graphical model, regularized Latent Dirichlet Allocation (rLDA). In the proposed approach, tag similarity and tag relevance are jointly estimated in an iterative manner, so that they can benefit from each other, and the multi-wise relationships among tags are explored. Moreover, both the statistics of tags and visual affinities of images in the corpus are explored to help topic modeling. We also analyze the superiority of our approach from the deep structure perspective.

7189,"RAProp: Ranking Tweets by Exploiting the Tweet/User/Web Ecosystem and
  Inter-Tweet Agreement","The increasing popularity of Twitter renders improved trustworthiness and relevance assessment of tweets much more important for search. However, given the limitations on the size of tweets, it is hard to extract measures for ranking from the tweets' content alone. We present a novel ranking method, called RAProp, which combines two orthogonal measures of relevance and trustworthiness of a tweet. The first, called Feature Score, measures the trustworthiness of the source of the tweet. This is done by extracting features from a 3-layer twitter ecosystem, consisting of users, tweets and the pages referred to in the tweets. The second measure, called agreement analysis, estimates the trustworthiness of the content of the tweet, by analyzing how and whether the content is independently corroborated by other tweets. We view the candidate result set of tweets as the vertices of a graph, with the edges measuring the estimated agreement between each pair of tweets. The feature score is propagated over this agreement graph to compute the top-k tweets that have both trustworthy sources and independent corroboration. The evaluation of our method on 16 million tweets from the TREC 2011 Microblog Dataset shows that for top-30 precision we achieve 53% higher than current best performing method on the Dataset and over 300% over current Twitter Search. We also present a detailed internal empirical evaluation of RAProp in comparison to several alternative approaches proposed by us.",Information Retrieval

  semi-local diffusion","With the rapid growth of the Internet and overwhelming amount of information and choices that people are confronted with, recommender systems have been developed to effectively support users' decision-making process in the online systems. However, many recommendation algorithms suffer from the data sparsity problem, i.e. the user-object bipartite networks are so sparse that algorithms cannot accurately recommend objects for users. This data sparsity problem makes many well-known recommendation algorithms perform poorly. To solve the problem, we propose a recommendation algorithm based on the semi-local diffusion process on a user-object bipartite network. The numerical simulation on two sparse datasets, Amazon and Bookcross, show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods especially for those small-degree users. Two personalized semi-local diffusion methods are proposed which further improve the recommendation accuracy. Finally, our work indicates that sparse online systems are essentially different from the dense online systems, all the algorithms and conclusions based on dense data should be rechecked again in sparse data.",Information Retrieval
7191,"Diversification Based Static Index Pruning - Application to Temporal
  Collections","Nowadays, web archives preserve the history of large portions of the web. As medias are shifting from printed to digital editions, accessing these huge information sources is drawing increasingly more attention from national and international institutions, as well as from the research community. These collections are intrinsically big, leading to index files that do not fit into the memory and an increase query response time. Decreasing the index size is a direct way to decrease this query response time.   Static index pruning methods reduce the size of indexes by removing a part of the postings. In the context of web archives, it is necessary to remove postings while preserving the temporal diversity of the archive. None of the existing pruning approaches take (temporal) diversification into account.   In this paper, we propose a diversification-based static index pruning method. It differs from the existing pruning approaches by integrating diversification within the pruning context. We aim at pruning the index while preserving retrieval effectiveness and diversity by pruning while maximizing a given IR evaluation metric like DCG. We show how to apply this approach in the context of web archives. Finally, we show on two collections that search effectiveness in temporal collections after pruning can be improved using our approach rather than diversity oblivious approaches.",Information Retrieval

7193,Indexing by Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Ensemble Model,"The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we present Indexing by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDI), an automatic document indexing method. The probability distributions in LDI utilize those in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a generative topic model that has been previously used in applications for document retrieval tasks. However, the ad hoc applications, or their variants with smoothing techniques as prompted by previous studies in LDA-based language modeling, result in unsatisfactory performance as the document representations do not accurately reflect concept space. To improve performance, we introduce a new definition of document probability vectors in the context of LDA and present a novel scheme for automatic document indexing based on LDA. Second, we propose an Ensemble Model (EnM) for document retrieval. The EnM combines basis indexing models by assigning different weights and attempts to uncover the optimal weights to maximize the Mean Average Precision (MAP). To solve the optimization problem, we propose an algorithm, EnM.B, which is derived based on the boosting method. The results of our computational experiments on benchmark data sets indicate that both the proposed approaches are viable options for document retrieval.",Information Retrieval

The search engine is planned to optimise the query due to the data input by user, thanks to the structure of text and melody index database. The system is planned to be a plug-in for popular digital music players or an independent player. An advanced system of recommendation based on information gathered from user's profile and search history is an integral part of the system. The recommendation mechanism uses scrobbling methods and is responsible for making suggestions of songs unknown to the user but similar to his preferred music styles and positioning search results.",Information Retrieval
7195,Improving Query Expansion Using WordNet,"This study proposes a new way of using WordNet for Query Expansion (QE). We choose candidate expansion terms, as usual, from a set of pseudo relevant documents; however, the usefulness of these terms is measured based on their definitions provided in a hand-crafted lexical resource like WordNet. Experiments with a number of standard TREC collections show that this method outperforms existing WordNet based methods. It also compares favorably with established QE methods such as KLD and RM3. Leveraging earlier work in which a combination of QE methods was found to outperform each individual method (as well as other well-known QE methods), we next propose a combination-based QE method that takes into account three different aspects of a candidate expansion term's usefulness: (i) its distribution in the pseudo relevant documents and in the target corpus, (ii) its statistical association with query terms, and (iii) its semantic relation with the query, as determined by the overlap between the WordNet definitions of the term and query terms. This combination of diverse sources of information appears to work well on a number of test collections, viz., TREC123, TREC5, TREC678, TREC robust new and TREC910 collections, and yields significant improvements over competing methods on most of these collections.",Information Retrieval
7196,"A Collaborative Filtering Based Approach for Recommending Elective
  Courses","In management education programmes today, students face a difficult time in choosing electives as the number of electives available are many. As the range and diversity of different elective courses available for selection have increased, course recommendation systems that help students in making choices about courses have become more relevant. In this paper we extend the concept of collaborative filtering approach to develop a course recommendation system. The proposed approach provides student an accurate prediction of the grade they may get if they choose a particular course, which will be helpful when they decide on selecting elective courses, as grade is an important parameter for a student while deciding on an elective course. We experimentally evaluate the collaborative filtering approach on a real life data set and show that the proposed system is effective in terms of accuracy.",Information Retrieval
7197,Improving tag recommendation by folding in more consistency,Tag recommendation is a major aspect of collaborative tagging systems. It aims to recommend tags to a user for tagging an item. In this paper we present a part of our work in progress which is a novel improvement of recommendations by re-ranking the output of a tag recommender. We mine association rules between candidates tags in order to determine a more consistent list of tags to recommend.   Our method is an add-on one which leads to better recommendations as we show in this paper. It is easily parallelizable and morever it may be applied to a lot of tag recommenders. The experiments we did on five datasets with two kinds of tag recommender demonstrated the efficiency of our method.,Information Retrieval
7198,Differential Data Analysis for Recommender Systems,"We present techniques to characterize which data is important to a recommender system and which is not. Important data is data that contributes most to the accuracy of the recommendation algorithm, while less important data contributes less to the accuracy or even decreases it. Characterizing the importance of data has two potential direct benefits: (1) increased privacy and (2) reduced data management costs, including storage. For privacy, we enable increased recommendation accuracy for comparable privacy levels using existing data obfuscation techniques. For storage, our results indicate that we can achieve large reductions in recommendation data and yet maintain recommendation accuracy.   Our main technique is called differential data analysis. The name is inspired by other sorts of differential analysis, such as differential power analysis and differential cryptanalysis, where insight comes through analysis of slightly differing inputs. In differential data analysis we chunk the data and compare results in the presence or absence of each chunk. We present results applying differential data analysis to two datasets and three different kinds of attributes. The first attribute is called user hardship. This is a novel attribute, particularly relevant to location datasets, that indicates how burdensome a data point was to achieve. The second and third attributes are more standard: timestamp and user rating. For user rating, we confirm previous work concerning the increased importance to the recommender of data corresponding to high and low user ratings.",Information Retrieval
7199,"Deeper Into the Folksonomy Graph: FolkRank Adaptations and Extensions
  for Improved Tag Recommendations","The information contained in social tagging systems is often modelled as a graph of connections between users, items and tags. Recommendation algorithms such as FolkRank, have the potential to leverage complex relationships in the data, corresponding to multiple hops in the graph. We present an in-depth analysis and evaluation of graph models for social tagging data and propose novel adaptations and extensions of FolkRank to improve tag recommendations. We highlight implicit assumptions made by the widely used folksonomy model, and propose an alternative and more accurate graph-representation of the data. Our extensions of FolkRank address the new item problem by incorporating content data into the algorithm, and significantly improve prediction results on unpruned datasets. Our adaptations address issues in the iterative weight spreading calculation that potentially hinder FolkRank's ability to leverage the deep graph as an information source. Moreover, we evaluate the benefit of considering each deeper level of the graph, and present important insights regarding the characteristics of social tagging data in general. Our results suggest that the base assumption made by conventional weight propagation methods, that closeness in the graph always implies a positive relationship, does not hold for the social tagging domain.",Information Retrieval

It also incorporates the blog-post concept clustering which is based on the category extracted from the blog post semantic content analysis. The proposed approach is titled as ""BloSen (Blog Search Engine)"". It involves in extracting the posts from blogs and parsing them to extract the blog elements and store them as fields in a document format. Inverted index is being built on the fields of the documents. Search is induced on the index and requested query is processed based on the documents so far made from blog posts. It currently focuses on Blogger and Wordpress hosted blogs since both these hosting services are the most popular ones in the blogosphere. The proposed BloSen model is experimented with a prototype implementation and the results of the experiments with the user's relevance cumulative metric value of 95.44% confirms the efficiency of the proposed model.",Information Retrieval

Search engines are retrieve the efficient information. We collected data on the Internet from several different sources, e.g., current as well as projected number of users, hosts, and Web sites. The trends cited by the sources are consistent and point to exponential growth in the past and in the coming decade. Hence it is not surprising that about 85% of Internet users surveyed claim using search engines and search services to find specific information and users are not satisfied with the performance of the current generation of search engines; the slow retrieval speed, communication delays, and poor quality of retrieved results. Web agents, programs acting autonomously on some task, are already present in the form of spiders, crawler, and robots. Agents offer substantial benefits and hazards, and because of this, their development must involve attention to technical details.

In this paper, we propose a query expansion technique that enriches queries expressed as keywords and short natural language descriptions. We present a new massive query expansion strategy that enriches queries using a knowledge base by identifying the query concepts, and adding relevant synonyms and semantically related terms. We propose two approaches: (i) lexical expansion that locates the relevant concepts in the knowledge base; and, (ii) topological expansion that analyzes the network of relations among the concepts, and suggests semantically related terms by path and community analysis of the knowledge graph. We perform our expansions by using two versions of the Wikipedia as knowledge base, concluding that the combination of both lexical and topological expansion provides improvements of the system's precision up to more than 27%.",Information Retrieval

In earlier they were considered the scripts such as java scripts and cascade styles in the html files. When it makes different for existing solutions to infer the regularity of the structure of the Web Pages only by analyzing the tag structures.

7205,Musical recommendations and personalization in a social network,"This paper presents a set of algorithms used for music recommendations and personalization in a general purpose social network www.ok.ru, the second largest social network in the CIS visited by more then 40 millions users per day. In addition to classical recommendation features like ""recommend a sequence"" and ""find similar items"" the paper describes novel algorithms for construction of context aware recommendations, personalization of the service, handling of the cold-start problem, and more. All algorithms described in the paper are working on-line and are able to detect and address changes in the user's behavior and needs in the real time.   The core component of the algorithms is a taste graph containing information about different entities (users, tracks, artists, etc.) and relations between them (for example, user A likes song B with certainty X, track B created by artist C, artist C is similar to artist D with certainty Y and so on). Using the graph it is possible to select tracks a user would most probably like, to arrange them in a way that they match each other well, to estimate which items from a fixed list are most relevant for the user, and more.   In addition, the paper describes the approach used to estimate algorithms efficiency and analyze the impact of different recommendation related features on the users' behavior and overall activity at the service.",Information Retrieval
7556,"Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with the MAXQ Value Function
  Decomposition","This paper presents the MAXQ approach to hierarchical reinforcement learning based on decomposing the target Markov decision process (MDP) into a hierarchy of smaller MDPs and decomposing the value function of the target MDP into an additive combination of the value functions of the smaller MDPs. The paper defines the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representational power, and establishes five conditions for the safe use of state abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges wih probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the five kinds of state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that MAXQ-Q (with state abstractions) converges to a recursively optimal policy much faster than flat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the value function has an important benefit: it makes it possible to compute and execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the policy improvement step of policy iteration. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the paper concludes with a comparison to related work and a discussion of the design tradeoffs in hierarchical reinforcement learning.",Machine Learning

However, little is known about learning with state abstractions, in which aspects of the state space are ignored. In previous work, we developed the MAXQ method for hierarchical RL. In this paper, we define five conditions under which state abstraction can be combined with the MAXQ value function decomposition. We prove that the MAXQ-Q learning algorithm converges under these conditions and show experimentally that state abstraction is important for the successful application of MAXQ-Q learning.",Machine Learning

  Analysis","The multiplicative Newton-like method developed by the author et al. is extended to the situation where the dynamics is restricted to the orthogonal group. A general framework is constructed without specifying the cost function. Though the restriction to the orthogonal groups makes the problem somewhat complicated, an explicit expression for the amount of individual jumps is obtained. This algorithm is exactly second-order-convergent. The global instability inherent in the Newton method is remedied by a Levenberg-Marquardt-type variation. The method thus constructed can readily be applied to the independent component analysis. Its remarkable performance is illustrated by a numerical simulation.",Machine Learning

The multiplicative updating rule here constructed is natural from the homogeneous nature of the Lie group and has numerous merits for the rigorous treatment of the dynamics. As one consequence, the second order convergence is shown. For the cost function, functions invariant under the componentwise scaling are choosen. By identifying points which can be transformed to each other by the scaling, we assume that the dynamics is in a coset space. In our method, a point can move toward any direction in this coset. Thus, no prewhitening is required.",Machine Learning
7560,Complexity analysis for algorithmically simple strings,"Given a reference computer, Kolmogorov complexity is a well defined function on all binary strings. In the standard approach, however, only the asymptotic properties of such functions are considered because they do not depend on the reference computer. We argue that this approach can be more useful if it is refined to include an important practical case of simple binary strings. Kolmogorov complexity calculus may be developed for this case if we restrict the class of available reference computers. The interesting problem is to define a class of computers which is restricted in a {\it natural} way modeling the real-life situation where only a limited class of computers is physically available to us. We give an example of what such a natural restriction might look like mathematically, and show that under such restrictions some error terms, even logarithmic in complexity, can disappear from the standard complexity calculus.

7561,Robust Classification for Imprecise Environments,"In real-world environments it usually is difficult to specify target operating conditions precisely, for example, target misclassification costs. This uncertainty makes building robust classification systems problematic. We show that it is possible to build a hybrid classifier that will perform at least as well as the best available classifier for any target conditions. In some cases, the performance of the hybrid actually can surpass that of the best known classifier. This robust performance extends across a wide variety of comparison frameworks, including the optimization of metrics such as accuracy, expected cost, lift, precision, recall, and workforce utilization. The hybrid also is efficient to build, to store, and to update. The hybrid is based on a method for the comparison of classifier performance that is robust to imprecise class distributions and misclassification costs. The ROC convex hull (ROCCH) method combines techniques from ROC analysis, decision analysis and computational geometry, and adapts them to the particulars of analyzing learned classifiers. The method is efficient and incremental, minimizes the management of classifier performance data, and allows for clear visual comparisons and sensitivity analyses. Finally, we point to empirical evidence that a robust hybrid classifier indeed is needed for many real-world problems.",Machine Learning

7563,Scaling Up Inductive Logic Programming by Learning from Interpretations,"When comparing inductive logic programming (ILP) and attribute-value learning techniques, there is a trade-off between expressive power and efficiency. Inductive logic programming techniques are typically more expressive but also less efficient. Therefore, the data sets handled by current inductive logic programming systems are small according to general standards within the data mining community. The main source of inefficiency lies in the assumption that several examples may be related to each other, so they cannot be handled independently.   Within the learning from interpretations framework for inductive logic programming this assumption is unnecessary, which allows to scale up existing ILP algorithms. In this paper we explain this learning setting in the context of relational databases. We relate the setting to propositional data mining and to the classical ILP setting, and show that learning from interpretations corresponds to learning from multiple relations and thus extends the expressiveness of propositional learning, while maintaining its efficiency to a large extent (which is not the case in the classical ILP setting).   As a case study, we present two alternative implementations of the ILP system Tilde (Top-down Induction of Logical DEcision trees): Tilde-classic, which loads all data in main memory, and Tilde-LDS, which loads the examples one by one. We experimentally compare the implementations, showing Tilde-LDS can handle large data sets (in the order of 100,000 examples or 100 MB) and indeed scales up linearly in the number of examples.",Machine Learning

In this case, we need to learn a reactive policy in a highly non-Markovian domain.

The parametric model is created as a set of spectral variants of a complete kernel matrix derived from another information source.

  by Statistical Learning Theory","To learn (statistical) dependencies among random variables requires exponentially large sample size in the number of observed random variables if any arbitrary joint probability distribution can occur.   We consider the case that sparse data strongly suggest that the probabilities can be described by a simple Bayesian network, i.e., by a graph with small in-degree \Delta. Then this simple law will also explain further data with high confidence. This is shown by calculating bounds on the VC dimension of the set of those probability measures that correspond to simple graphs. This allows to select networks by structural risk minimization and gives reliability bounds on the error of the estimated joint measure without (in contrast to a previous paper) any prior assumptions on the set of possible joint measures.   The complexity for searching the optimal Bayesian networks of in-degree \Delta increases only polynomially in the number of random varibales for constant \Delta and the optimal joint measure associated with a given graph can be found by convex optimization.",Machine Learning

First, we give an algorithm for learning decision lists of length $k$ over $n$ variables using $2^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})} \log n$ examples and time $n^{\tilde{O}(k^{1/3})}$. This is the first algorithm for learning decision lists that has both subexponential sample complexity and subexponential running time in the relevant parameters. Our approach establishes a relationship between attribute efficient learning and polynomial threshold functions and is based on a new construction of low degree, low weight polynomial threshold functions for decision lists. For a wide range of parameters our construction matches a 1994 lower bound due to Beigel for the ODDMAXBIT predicate and gives an essentially optimal tradeoff between polynomial threshold function degree and weight.   Second, we give an algorithm for learning an unknown parity function on $k$ out of $n$ variables using $O(n^{1-1/k})$ examples in time polynomial in $n$. For $k=o(\log n)$ this yields a polynomial time algorithm with sample complexity $o(n)$.

Any deviation from this learned profile is then considered as an unexpected situation. Moreover, complex applications may involve the temporal study of several heterogeneous parameters. In that paper, we propose a method for mining heterogeneous multivariate time-series for learning meaningful patterns.

We shall call the algorithm `stable' if, when y_i is a noisy version of f*(x_i) for some function f* in H, the output of the algorithm converges to f* as the regularization term and noise simultaneously vanish. We consider two flavors of this problem, one where a data set of N points remains fixed, and the other where N -> infinity. For the case where N -> infinity, we give conditions for convergence to f_E (the function which is the expectation of y(x) for each x), as lambda -> 0. For the fixed N case, we describe the limiting 'non-noisy', 'non-regularized' function f*, and give conditions for convergence. In the process, we develop a set of tools for dealing with functionals such as L(f), which are applicable to many other problems in learning theory.",Machine Learning

To prove our result, we analyze the topological structure of the probability hierarchy. We prove that it is well-ordered in descending ordering and order-equivalent to ordinal epsilon_0.

7576,Defensive forecasting for linear protocols,"We consider a general class of forecasting protocols, called ""linear protocols"", and discuss several important special cases, including multi-class forecasting. Forecasting is formalized as a game between three players: Reality, whose role is to generate observations; Forecaster, whose goal is to predict the observations; and Skeptic, who tries to make money on any lack of agreement between Forecaster's predictions and the actual observations. Our main mathematical result is that for any continuous strategy for Skeptic in a linear protocol there exists a strategy for Forecaster that does not allow Skeptic's capital to grow. This result is a meta-theorem that allows one to transform any continuous law of probability in a linear protocol into a forecasting strategy whose predictions are guaranteed to satisfy this law. We apply this meta-theorem to a weak law of large numbers in Hilbert spaces to obtain a version of the K29 prediction algorithm for linear protocols and show that this version also satisfies the attractive properties of proper calibration and resolution under a suitable choice of its kernel parameter, with no assumptions about the way the data is generated.",Machine Learning

This methodology is a template procedure which can be applied on most kernels on measures and takes advantage of a more detailed ""bag of components"" representation of the objects. To obtain such a detailed description, we consider possible decompositions of the original bag into a collection of nested bags, following a prior knowledge on the objects' structure. We then consider these smaller bags to compare two objects both in a detailed perspective, stressing local matches between the smaller bags, and in a global or coarse perspective, by considering the entire bag. This multiresolution approach is likely to be best suited for tasks where the coarse approach is not precise enough, and where a more subtle mixture of both local and global similarities is necessary to compare objects. The approach presented here would not be computationally tractable without a factorization trick that we introduce before presenting promising results on an image retrieval task.",Machine Learning
7580,Defensive Universal Learning with Experts,"This paper shows how universal learning can be achieved with expert advice. To this aim, we specify an experts algorithm with the following characteristics: (a) it uses only feedback from the actions actually chosen (bandit setup), (b) it can be applied with countably infinite expert classes, and (c) it copes with losses that may grow in time appropriately slowly. We prove loss bounds against an adaptive adversary. From this, we obtain a master algorithm for ""reactive"" experts problems, which means that the master's actions may influence the behavior of the adversary. Our algorithm can significantly outperform standard experts algorithms on such problems. Finally, we combine it with a universal expert class. The resulting universal learner performs -- in a certain sense -- almost as well as any computable strategy, for any online decision problem.

In partial observation cases, it was not clear how to obtain performance guarantees against adaptive adversary, without worsening the bounds. We propose a conceptually simple argument to resolve this problem. Using this, a regret bound of O(t^(2/3)) for FPL in the adversarial multi-armed bandit problem is shown. This bound holds for the common FPL variant using only the observations from designated exploration rounds. Using all observations allows for the stronger bound of O(t^(1/2)), matching the best bound known so far (and essentially the known lower bound) for adversarial bandits. Surprisingly, this variant does not even need explicit exploration, it is self-stabilizing. However the sampling probabilities have to be either externally provided or approximated to sufficient accuracy, using O(t^2 log t) samples in each step.",Machine Learning
7582,Learning Optimal Augmented Bayes Networks,"Naive Bayes is a simple Bayesian classifier with strong independence assumptions among the attributes. This classifier, desipte its strong independence assumptions, often performs well in practice. It is believed that relaxing the independence assumptions of a naive Bayes classifier may improve the classification accuracy of the resulting structure. While finding an optimal unconstrained Bayesian Network (for most any reasonable scoring measure) is an NP-hard problem, it is possible to learn in polynomial time optimal networks obeying various structural restrictions. Several authors have examined the possibilities of adding augmenting arcs between attributes of a Naive Bayes classifier. Friedman, Geiger and Goldszmidt define the TAN structure in which the augmenting arcs form a tree on the attributes, and present a polynomial time algorithm that learns an optimal TAN with respect to MDL score. Keogh and Pazzani define Augmented Bayes Networks in which the augmenting arcs form a forest on the attributes (a collection of trees, hence a relaxation of the stuctural restriction of TAN), and present heuristic search methods for learning good, though not optimal, augmenting arc sets. The authors, however, evaluate the learned structure only in terms of observed misclassification error and not against a scoring metric, such as MDL.

We obtain poly$(n, \log b)$-time algorithms for the following classes:   - poly$(n \log b)$-way Majority of $O(\frac{\log(n \log b)} {\log \log(n \log b)})$-dimensional rectangles.   - Union of poly$(\log(n \log b))$ many $O(\frac{\log^2 (n \log b)} {(\log \log(n \log b) \log \log \log (n \log b))^2})$-dimensional rectangles.   - poly$(n \log b)$-way Majority of poly$(n \log b)$-Or of disjoint $O(\frac{\log(n \log b)} {\log \log(n \log b)})$-dimensional rectangles.   Our main algorithmic tool is an extension of Jackson's boosting- and Fourier-based Harmonic Sieve algorithm [Jackson 1997] to the domain $[b]^n$, building on work of [Akavia, Goldwasser, Safra 2003]. Other ingredients used to obtain the results stated above are techniques from exact learning [Beimel, Kushilevitz 1998] and ideas from recent work on learning augmented $AC^{0}$ circuits [Jackson, Klivans, Servedio 2002] and on representing Boolean functions as thresholds of parities [Klivans, Servedio 2001].",Machine Learning
7584,On-line regression competitive with reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces,"We consider the problem of on-line prediction of real-valued labels, assumed bounded in absolute value by a known constant, of new objects from known labeled objects. The prediction algorithm's performance is measured by the squared deviation of the predictions from the actual labels. No stochastic assumptions are made about the way the labels and objects are generated. Instead, we are given a benchmark class of prediction rules some of which are hoped to produce good predictions. We show that for a wide range of infinite-dimensional benchmark classes one can construct a prediction algorithm whose cumulative loss over the first N examples does not exceed the cumulative loss of any prediction rule in the class plus O(sqrt(N)); the main differences from the known results are that we do not impose any upper bound on the norm of the considered prediction rules and that we achieve an optimal leading term in the excess loss of our algorithm. If the benchmark class is ""universal"" (dense in the class of continuous functions on each compact set), this provides an on-line non-stochastic analogue of universally consistent prediction in non-parametric statistics. We use two proof techniques: one is based on the Aggregating Algorithm and the other on the recently developed method of defensive forecasting.",Machine Learning
7585,Bounds on Query Convergence,"The problem of finding an optimum using noisy evaluations of a smooth cost function arises in many contexts, including economics, business, medicine, experiment design, and foraging theory. We derive an asymptotic bound E[ (x_t - x*)^2 ] >= O(1/sqrt(t)) on the rate of convergence of a sequence (x_0, x_1, >...) generated by an unbiased feedback process observing noisy evaluations of an unknown quadratic function maximised at x*. The bound is tight, as the proof leads to a simple algorithm which meets it. We further establish a bound on the total regret, E[ sum_{i=1..t} (x_i - x*)^2 ] >= O(sqrt(t)) These bounds may impose practical limitations on an agent's performance, as O(eps^-4) queries are made before the queries converge to x* with eps accuracy.",Machine Learning
7586,Preference Learning in Terminology Extraction: A ROC-based approach,"A key data preparation step in Text Mining, Term Extraction selects the terms, or collocation of words, attached to specific concepts. In this paper, the task of extracting relevant collocations is achieved through a supervised learning algorithm, exploiting a few collocations manually labelled as relevant/irrelevant. The candidate terms are described along 13 standard statistical criteria measures. From these examples, an evolutionary learning algorithm termed Roger, based on the optimization of the Area under the ROC curve criterion, extracts an order on the candidate terms. The robustness of the approach is demonstrated on two real-world domain applications, considering different domains (biology and human resources) and different languages (English and French).",Machine Learning
7587,Competing with wild prediction rules,"We consider the problem of on-line prediction competitive with a benchmark class of continuous but highly irregular prediction rules. It is known that if the benchmark class is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, there exists a prediction algorithm whose average loss over the first N examples does not exceed the average loss of any prediction rule in the class plus a ""regret term"" of O(N^(-1/2)). The elements of some natural benchmark classes, however, are so irregular that these classes are not Hilbert spaces. In this paper we develop Banach-space methods to construct a prediction algorithm with a regret term of O(N^(-1/p)), where p is in [2,infty) and p-2 reflects the degree to which the benchmark class fails to be a Hilbert space.",Machine Learning

This process can be assimilated to a learning task, with the inference of models from a limited number of samples. This paper is an investigation on two methods to improve generalization in GP-based learning: 1) the selection of the best-of-run individuals using a three data sets methodology, and 2) the application of parsimony pressure in order to reduce the complexity of the solutions. Results using GP in a binary classification setup show that while the accuracy on the test sets is preserved, with less variances compared to baseline results, the mean tree size obtained with the tested methods is significantly reduced.",Machine Learning

With the classical test theory approach test scores of examinees and items are calculated traditionally as sums of matrix elements, organized in rows and columns. Correlation coefficients are estimated using correction coefficients. In item response theory approach examinee and item logits are estimated using maximum likelihood method and probabilities of all matrix elements.",Machine Learning
7590,Learning rational stochastic languages,"Given a finite set of words w1,...,wn independently drawn according to a fixed unknown distribution law P called a stochastic language, an usual goal in Grammatical Inference is to infer an estimate of P in some class of probabilistic models, such as Probabilistic Automata (PA). Here, we study the class of rational stochastic languages, which consists in stochastic languages that can be generated by Multiplicity Automata (MA) and which strictly includes the class of stochastic languages generated by PA. Rational stochastic languages have minimal normal representation which may be very concise, and whose parameters can be efficiently estimated from stochastic samples. We design an efficient inference algorithm DEES which aims at building a minimal normal representation of the target. Despite the fact that no recursively enumerable class of MA computes exactly the set of rational stochastic languages over Q, we show that DEES strongly identifies tis set in the limit. We study the intermediary MA output by DEES and show that they compute rational series which converge absolutely to one and which can be used to provide stochastic languages which closely estimate the target.",Machine Learning
7591,General Discounting versus Average Reward,"Consider an agent interacting with an environment in cycles. In every interaction cycle the agent is rewarded for its performance. We compare the average reward U from cycle 1 to m (average value) with the future discounted reward V from cycle k to infinity (discounted value). We consider essentially arbitrary (non-geometric) discount sequences and arbitrary reward sequences (non-MDP environments). We show that asymptotically U for m->infinity and V for k->infinity are equal, provided both limits exist. Further, if the effective horizon grows linearly with k or faster, then existence of the limit of U implies that the limit of V exists. Conversely, if the effective horizon grows linearly with k or slower, then existence of the limit of V implies that the limit of U exists.",Machine Learning
7592,On Sequence Prediction for Arbitrary Measures,"Suppose we are given two probability measures on the set of one-way infinite finite-alphabet sequences and consider the question when one of the measures predicts the other, that is, when conditional probabilities converge (in a certain sense) when one of the measures is chosen to generate the sequence. This question may be considered a refinement of the problem of sequence prediction in its most general formulation: for a given class of probability measures, does there exist a measure which predicts all of the measures in the class? To address this problem, we find some conditions on local absolute continuity which are sufficient for prediction and which generalize several different notions which are known to be sufficient for prediction. We also formulate some open questions to outline a direction for finding the conditions on classes of measures for which prediction is possible.",Machine Learning
7593,Predictions as statements and decisions,"Prediction is a complex notion, and different predictors (such as people, computer programs, and probabilistic theories) can pursue very different goals.

7594,PAC Classification based on PAC Estimates of Label Class Distributions,"A standard approach in pattern classification is to estimate the distributions of the label classes, and then to apply the Bayes classifier to the estimates of the distributions in order to classify unlabeled examples. As one might expect, the better our estimates of the label class distributions, the better the resulting classifier will be. In this paper we make this observation precise by identifying risk bounds of a classifier in terms of the quality of the estimates of the label class distributions. We show how PAC learnability relates to estimates of the distributions that have a PAC guarantee on their $L_1$ distance from the true distribution, and we bound the increase in negative log likelihood risk in terms of PAC bounds on the KL-divergence. We give an inefficient but general-purpose smoothing method for converting an estimated distribution that is good under the $L_1$ metric into a distribution that is good under the KL-divergence.",Machine Learning
7595,Competing with stationary prediction strategies,"In this paper we introduce the class of stationary prediction strategies and construct a prediction algorithm that asymptotically performs as well as the best continuous stationary strategy. We make mild compactness assumptions but no stochastic assumptions about the environment. In particular, no assumption of stationarity is made about the environment, and the stationarity of the considered strategies only means that they do not depend explicitly on time; we argue that it is natural to consider only stationary strategies even for highly non-stationary environments.",Machine Learning
7596,"Using Pseudo-Stochastic Rational Languages in Probabilistic Grammatical
  Inference","In probabilistic grammatical inference, a usual goal is to infer a good approximation of an unknown distribution P called a stochastic language. The estimate of P stands in some class of probabilistic models such as probabilistic automata (PA). In this paper, we focus on probabilistic models based on multiplicity automata (MA). The stochastic languages generated by MA are called rational stochastic languages; they strictly include stochastic languages generated by PA; they also admit a very concise canonical representation. Despite the fact that this class is not recursively enumerable, it is efficiently identifiable in the limit by using the algorithm DEES, introduced by the authors in a previous paper. However, the identification is not proper and before the convergence of the algorithm, DEES can produce MA that do not define stochastic languages. Nevertheless, it is possible to use these MA to define stochastic languages. We show that they belong to a broader class of rational series, that we call pseudo-stochastic rational languages. The aim of this paper is twofold. First we provide a theoretical study of pseudo-stochastic rational languages, the languages output by DEES, showing for example that this class is decidable within polynomial time. Second, we have carried out a lot of experiments in order to compare DEES to classical inference algorithms such as ALERGIA and MDI. They show that DEES outperforms them in most cases.",Machine Learning
7597,"Logical settings for concept learning from incomplete examples in First
  Order Logic","We investigate here concept learning from incomplete examples. Our first purpose is to discuss to what extent logical learning settings have to be modified in order to cope with data incompleteness. More precisely we are interested in extending the learning from interpretations setting introduced by L. De Raedt that extends to relational representations the classical propositional (or attribute-value) concept learning from examples framework. We are inspired here by ideas presented by H. Hirsh in a work extending the Version space inductive paradigm to incomplete data. H. Hirsh proposes to slightly modify the notion of solution when dealing with incomplete examples: a solution has to be a hypothesis compatible with all pieces of information concerning the examples. We identify two main classes of incompleteness. First, uncertainty deals with our state of knowledge concerning an example. Second, generalization (or abstraction) deals with what part of the description of the example is sufficient for the learning purpose. These two main sources of incompleteness can be mixed up when only part of the useful information is known. We discuss a general learning setting, referred to as ""learning from possibilities"" that formalizes these ideas, then we present a more specific learning setting, referred to as ""assumption-based learning"" that cope with examples which uncertainty can be reduced when considering contextual information outside of the proper description of the examples. Assumption-based learning is illustrated on a recent work concerning the prediction of a consensus secondary structure common to a set of RNA sequences.",Machine Learning

""Nested tree,"" ""embedded tree"" and ""recursive tree"" are also appropriate names for this algorithm, which is one of our contributions. Our other contribution is the theoretical analysis of the algorithms, in which we give training error bounds. This analysis suggests that the matryoshka leverages probabilistic weak classifiers more efficiently than simple decision trees.",Machine Learning
7599,Leading strategies in competitive on-line prediction,"We start from a simple asymptotic result for the problem of on-line regression with the quadratic loss function: the class of continuous limited-memory prediction strategies admits a ""leading prediction strategy"", which not only asymptotically performs at least as well as any continuous limited-memory strategy but also satisfies the property that the excess loss of any continuous limited-memory strategy is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy. More specifically, for any class of prediction strategies constituting a reproducing kernel Hilbert space we construct a leading strategy, in the sense that the loss of any prediction strategy whose norm is not too large is determined by how closely it imitates the leading strategy. This result is extended to the loss functions given by Bregman divergences and by strictly proper scoring rules.",Machine Learning

Then we present Lambek grammars, a formalism issued from categorial grammars which, although not as expressive as needed for a full formalization of natural languages, is particularly suited to easily implement a natural interface between syntax and semantics. In the last part of this work, we present a learnability result for Rigid Lambek grammars from structured examples.",Machine Learning

The local rules are considered as projections of the global classification rules to the event we want to classify. A massive global optimization algorithm is used for optimization of quality criterion. The algorithm, which has polynomial complexity in typical case, is used to find all high--quality local rules. The other distinctive feature of the algorithm is the integration of attributes levels selection (for ordered attributes) with rules searching and original conflicting rules resolution strategy. The algorithm is practical; it was tested on a number of data sets from UCI repository, and a comparison with the other predicting techniques is presented.",Machine Learning

The predictor's goal is to compete with a benchmark class of prediction rules, which is often a proper Banach function space. Metric entropy provides a unifying framework for competitive on-line prediction: the numerous known upper bounds on the metric entropy of various compact sets in function spaces readily imply bounds on the performance of on-line prediction strategies. This paper discusses strengths and limitations of the direct approach to competitive on-line prediction via metric entropy, including comparisons to other approaches.",Machine Learning
7604,"PAC Learning Mixtures of Axis-Aligned Gaussians with No Separation
  Assumption","We propose and analyze a new vantage point for the learning of mixtures of Gaussians: namely, the PAC-style model of learning probability distributions introduced by Kearns et al. Here the task is to construct a hypothesis mixture of Gaussians that is statistically indistinguishable from the actual mixture generating the data; specifically, the KL-divergence should be at most epsilon.   In this scenario, we give a poly(n/epsilon)-time algorithm that learns the class of mixtures of any constant number of axis-aligned Gaussians in n-dimensional Euclidean space. Our algorithm makes no assumptions about the separation between the means of the Gaussians, nor does it have any dependence on the minimum mixing weight. This is in contrast to learning results known in the ``clustering'' model, where such assumptions are unavoidable.   Our algorithm relies on the method of moments, and a subalgorithm developed in previous work by the authors (FOCS 2005) for a discrete mixture-learning problem.",Machine Learning
7605,Hedging predictions in machine learning,"Recent advances in machine learning make it possible to design efficient prediction algorithms for data sets with huge numbers of parameters. This paper describes a new technique for ""hedging"" the predictions output by many such algorithms, including support vector machines, kernel ridge regression, kernel nearest neighbours, and by many other state-of-the-art methods. The hedged predictions for the labels of new objects include quantitative measures of their own accuracy and reliability. These measures are provably valid under the assumption of randomness, traditional in machine learning: the objects and their labels are assumed to be generated independently from the same probability distribution. In particular, it becomes possible to control (up to statistical fluctuations) the number of erroneous predictions by selecting a suitable confidence level. Validity being achieved automatically, the remaining goal of hedged prediction is efficiency: taking full account of the new objects' features and other available information to produce as accurate predictions as possible. This can be done successfully using the powerful machinery of modern machine learning.",Machine Learning

  Equi-Gradient Descent TD","This paper addresses the issue of policy evaluation in Markov Decision Processes, using linear function approximation. It provides a unified view of algorithms such as TD(lambda), LSTD(lambda), iLSTD, residual-gradient TD. It is asserted that they all consist in minimizing a gradient function and differ by the form of this function and their means of minimizing it. Two new schemes are introduced in that framework: Full-gradient TD which uses a generalization of the principle introduced in iLSTD, and EGD TD, which reduces the gradient by successive equi-gradient descents. These three algorithms form a new intermediate family with the interesting property of making much better use of the samples than TD while keeping a gradient descent scheme, which is useful for complexity issues and optimistic policy iteration.",Machine Learning
7607,Bandit Algorithms for Tree Search,"Bandit based methods for tree search have recently gained popularity when applied to huge trees, e.g. in the game of go (Gelly et al., 2006). The UCT algorithm (Kocsis and Szepesvari, 2006), a tree search method based on Upper Confidence Bounds (UCB) (Auer et al., 2002), is believed to adapt locally to the effective smoothness of the tree. However, we show that UCT is too ``optimistic'' in some cases, leading to a regret O(exp(exp(D))) where D is the depth of the tree. We propose alternative bandit algorithms for tree search. First, a modification of UCT using a confidence sequence that scales exponentially with the horizon depth is proven to have a regret O(2^D \sqrt{n}), but does not adapt to possible smoothness in the tree. We then analyze Flat-UCB performed on the leaves and provide a finite regret bound with high probability. Then, we introduce a UCB-based Bandit Algorithm for Smooth Trees which takes into account actual smoothness of the rewards for performing efficient ``cuts'' of sub-optimal branches with high confidence. Finally, we present an incremental tree search version which applies when the full tree is too big (possibly infinite) to be entirely represented and show that with high probability, essentially only the optimal branches is indefinitely developed. We illustrate these methods on a global optimization problem of a Lipschitz function, given noisy data.",Machine Learning
7608,Intrinsic dimension of a dataset: what properties does one expect?,"We propose an axiomatic approach to the concept of an intrinsic dimension of a dataset, based on a viewpoint of geometry of high-dimensional structures. Our first axiom postulates that high values of dimension be indicative of the presence of the curse of dimensionality (in a certain precise mathematical sense). The second axiom requires the dimension to depend smoothly on a distance between datasets (so that the dimension of a dataset and that of an approximating principal manifold would be close to each other). The third axiom is a normalization condition: the dimension of the Euclidean $n$-sphere $\s^n$ is $\Theta(n)$. We give an example of a dimension function satisfying our axioms, even though it is in general computationally unfeasible, and discuss a computationally cheap function satisfying most but not all of our axioms (the ``intrinsic dimensionality'' of Ch\'avez et al.)",Machine Learning
7609,Parametric Learning and Monte Carlo Optimization,"This paper uncovers and explores the close relationship between Monte Carlo Optimization of a parametrized integral (MCO), Parametric machine-Learning (PL), and `blackbox' or `oracle'-based optimization (BO). We make four contributions. First, we prove that MCO is mathematically identical to a broad class of PL problems. This identity potentially provides a new application domain for all broadly applicable PL techniques: MCO. Second, we introduce immediate sampling, a new version of the Probability Collectives (PC) algorithm for blackbox optimization. Immediate sampling transforms the original BO problem into an MCO problem. Accordingly, by combining these first two contributions, we can apply all PL techniques to BO. In our third contribution we validate this way of improving BO by demonstrating that cross-validation and bagging improve immediate sampling. Finally, conventional MC and MCO procedures ignore the relationship between the sample point locations and the associated values of the integrand; only the values of the integrand at those locations are considered. We demonstrate that one can exploit the sample location information using PL techniques, for example by forming a fit of the sample locations to the associated values of the integrand. This provides an additional way to apply PL techniques to improve MCO.",Machine Learning
7610,Supervised Feature Selection via Dependence Estimation,"We introduce a framework for filtering features that employs the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) as a measure of dependence between the features and the labels.

  Techniques","Speaker identification is a powerful, non-invasive and in-expensive biometric technique. The recognition accuracy, however, deteriorates when noise levels affect a specific band of frequency. In this paper, we present a sub-band based speaker identification that intends to improve the live testing performance. Each frequency sub-band is processed and classified independently. We also compare the linear and non-linear merging techniques for the sub-bands recognizer. Support vector machines and Gaussian Mixture models are the non-linear merging techniques that are investigated. Results showed that the sub-band based method used with linear merging techniques enormously improved the performance of the speaker identification over the performance of wide-band recognizers when tested live. A live testing improvement of 9.78% was achieved",Machine Learning

They usually involve as capacity measure of the model studied the VC dimension or one of its extensions. In classification, such ""VC dimensions"" exist for models taking values in {0, 1}, {1,..., Q} and R. We introduce the generalizations appropriate for the missing case, the one of models with values in R^Q. This provides us with a new guaranteed risk for M-SVMs which appears superior to the existing one.",Machine Learning
7613,Consistency of the group Lasso and multiple kernel learning,"We consider the least-square regression problem with regularization by a block 1-norm, i.e., a sum of Euclidean norms over spaces of dimensions larger than one. This problem, referred to as the group Lasso, extends the usual regularization by the 1-norm where all spaces have dimension one, where it is commonly referred to as the Lasso. In this paper, we study the asymptotic model consistency of the group Lasso. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the consistency of group Lasso under practical assumptions, such as model misspecification. When the linear predictors and Euclidean norms are replaced by functions and reproducing kernel Hilbert norms, the problem is usually referred to as multiple kernel learning and is commonly used for learning from heterogeneous data sources and for non linear variable selection. Using tools from functional analysis, and in particular covariance operators, we extend the consistency results to this infinite dimensional case and also propose an adaptive scheme to obtain a consistent model estimate, even when the necessary condition required for the non adaptive scheme is not satisfied.",Machine Learning
7614,"Cost-minimising strategies for data labelling : optimal stopping and
  active learning","Supervised learning deals with the inference of a distribution over an output or label space $\CY$ conditioned on points in an observation space $\CX$, given a training dataset $D$ of pairs in $\CX \times \CY$. However, in a lot of applications of interest, acquisition of large amounts of observations is easy, while the process of generating labels is time-consuming or costly. One way to deal with this problem is {\em active} learning, where points to be labelled are selected with the aim of creating a model with better performance than that of an model trained on an equal number of randomly sampled points. In this paper, we instead propose to deal with the labelling cost directly: The learning goal is defined as the minimisation of a cost which is a function of the expected model performance and the total cost of the labels used. This allows the development of general strategies and specific algorithms for (a) optimal stopping, where the expected cost dictates whether label acquisition should continue (b) empirical evaluation, where the cost is used as a performance metric for a given combination of inference, stopping and sampling methods. Though the main focus of the paper is optimal stopping, we also aim to provide the background for further developments and discussion in the related field of active learning.",Machine Learning

There are two known varieties of defensive forecasting: ""continuous"", in which Sceptic's moves are assumed to depend on the forecasts in a (semi)continuous manner and which produces deterministic forecasts, and ""randomized"", in which the dependence of Sceptic's moves on the forecasts is arbitrary and Forecaster's moves are allowed to be randomized. This note shows that the randomized variety can be obtained from the continuous variety by smearing Sceptic's moves to make them continuous.",Machine Learning

These methods need to solve the eigenproblem whose computational complexity is $O(n^3)$, where $n$ is the number of data samples. In this paper, a non-eigenproblem based clustering method is proposed to deal with the clustering problem. Its performance is comparable to the spectral clustering algorithms but it is more efficient with computational complexity $O(n^2)$. We show that with a transitive distance and an observed property, called K-means duality, our algorithm can be used to handle data sets with complex cluster shapes, multi-scale clusters, and noise. Moreover, no parameters except the number of clusters need to be set in our algorithm.",Machine Learning

7622,On the Relationship between the Posterior and Optimal Similarity,"For a classification problem described by the joint density $P(\omega,x)$, models of $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ (the ``Bayesian similarity measure'') have been shown to be an optimal similarity measure for nearest neighbor classification. This paper analyzes demonstrates several additional properties of that conditional distribution. The paper first shows that we can reconstruct, up to class labels, the class posterior distribution $P(\omega|x)$ given $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$, gives a procedure for recovering the class labels, and gives an asymptotically Bayes-optimal classification procedure. It also shows, given such an optimal similarity measure, how to construct a classifier that outperforms the nearest neighbor classifier and achieves Bayes-optimal classification rates. The paper then analyzes Bayesian similarity in a framework where a classifier faces a number of related classification tasks (multitask learning) and illustrates that reconstruction of the class posterior distribution is not possible in general. Finally, the paper identifies a distinct class of classification problems using $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ and shows that using $P(\omega\eq\omega'|x,x')$ to solve those problems is the Bayes optimal solution.",Machine Learning
7623,Equations of States in Singular Statistical Estimation,"Learning machines which have hierarchical structures or hidden variables are singular statistical models because they are nonidentifiable and their Fisher information matrices are singular. In singular statistical models, neither the Bayes a posteriori distribution converges to the normal distribution nor the maximum likelihood estimator satisfies asymptotic normality. This is the main reason why it has been difficult to predict their generalization performances from trained states. In this paper, we study four errors, (1) Bayes generalization error, (2) Bayes training error, (3) Gibbs generalization error, and (4) Gibbs training error, and prove that there are mathematical relations among these errors. The formulas proved in this paper are equations of states in statistical estimation because they hold for any true distribution, any parametric model, and any a priori distribution. Also we show that Bayes and Gibbs generalization errors are estimated by Bayes and Gibbs training errors, and propose widely applicable information criteria which can be applied to both regular and singular statistical models.",Machine Learning
7624,Density estimation in linear time,"We consider the problem of choosing a density estimate from a set of distributions F, minimizing the L1-distance to an unknown distribution (Devroye, Lugosi 2001). Devroye and Lugosi analyze two algorithms for the problem: Scheffe tournament winner and minimum distance estimate. The Scheffe tournament estimate requires fewer computations than the minimum distance estimate, but has strictly weaker guarantees than the latter.   We focus on the computational aspect of density estimation. We present two algorithms, both with the same guarantee as the minimum distance estimate. The first one, a modification of the minimum distance estimate, uses the same number (quadratic in |F|) of computations as the Scheffe tournament. The second one, called ``efficient minimum loss-weight estimate,'' uses only a linear number of computations, assuming that F is preprocessed.   We also give examples showing that the guarantees of the algorithms cannot be improved and explore randomized algorithms for density estimation.",Machine Learning

In this paper, we present extensions of graph kernels for point clouds, which allow to use kernel methods for such ob jects as shapes, line drawings, or any three-dimensional point clouds. In order to design rich and numerically efficient kernels with as few free parameters as possible, we use kernels between covariance matrices and their factorizations on graphical models. We derive polynomial time dynamic programming recursions and present applications to recognition of handwritten digits and Chinese characters from few training examples.",Machine Learning

XR, we assume that each group is the result of one underlying latent variable, and that all latent variables are bound together through a linear equation system. Moreover, we assume that some explanatory latent variables may interact pairwise in one or more equations. We basically consider PLS Path Modelling's algorithm to estimate both latent variables and the model's coefficients. New ""external"" estimation schemes are proposed that draw latent variables towards strong group structures in a more flexible way. New ""internal"" estimation schemes are proposed to enable PLSPM to make good use of variable group complementarity and to deal with interactions. Application examples are given.",Machine Learning
7629,"A New Approach to Collaborative Filtering: Operator Estimation with
  Spectral Regularization","We present a general approach for collaborative filtering (CF) using spectral regularization to learn linear operators from ""users"" to the ""objects"" they rate. Recent low-rank type matrix completion approaches to CF are shown to be special cases. However, unlike existing regularization based CF methods, our approach can be used to also incorporate information such as attributes of the users or the objects -- a limitation of existing regularization based CF methods. We then provide novel representer theorems that we use to develop new estimation methods. We provide learning algorithms based on low-rank decompositions, and test them on a standard CF dataset. The experiments indicate the advantages of generalizing the existing regularization based CF methods to incorporate related information about users and objects. Finally, we show that certain multi-task learning methods can be also seen as special cases of our proposed approach.",Machine Learning
7630,Multiple Random Oracles Are Better Than One,"We study the problem of learning k-juntas given access to examples drawn from a number of different product distributions. Thus we wish to learn a function f : {-1,1}^n -> {-1,1} that depends on k (unknown) coordinates. While the best known algorithms for the general problem of learning a k-junta require running time of n^k * poly(n,2^k), we show that given access to k different product distributions with biases separated by \gamma>0, the functions may be learned in time poly(n,2^k,\gamma^{-k}). More generally, given access to t <= k different product distributions, the functions may be learned in time n^{k/t} * poly(n,2^k,\gamma^{-k}). Our techniques involve novel results in Fourier analysis relating Fourier expansions with respect to different biases and a generalization of Russo's formula.",Machine Learning

The paper discusses the architecture of the relational network and its merits compared to a neural network and most other computational intelligence classifiers. Results gathered from the study indicate comparable classification accuracies as well as revealed relationships between data features in the classification data. Much higher classification accuracies are recommended for future research in the area of HIV classification as well as missing data estimation.,Machine Learning
7632,"The Effect of Structural Diversity of an Ensemble of Classifiers on
  Classification Accuracy","This paper aims to showcase the measure of structural diversity of an ensemble of 9 classifiers and then map a relationship between this structural diversity and accuracy. The structural diversity was induced by having different architectures or structures of the classifiers The Genetical Algorithms (GA) were used to derive the relationship between diversity and the classification accuracy by evolving the classifiers and then picking 9 classifiers out on an ensemble of 60 classifiers. It was found that as the ensemble became diverse the accuracy improved. However at a certain diversity measure the accuracy began to drop. The Kohavi-Wolpert variance method is used to measure the diversity of the ensemble. A method of voting is used to aggregate the results from each classifier. The lowest error was observed at a diversity measure of 0.16 with a mean square error of 0.274, when taking 0.2024 as maximum diversity measured. The parameters that were varied were: the number of hidden nodes, learning rate and the activation function.",Machine Learning
7633,A Quadratic Loss Multi-Class SVM,"Using a support vector machine requires to set two types of hyperparameters: the soft margin parameter C and the parameters of the kernel. To perform this model selection task, the method of choice is cross-validation. Its leave-one-out variant is known to produce an estimator of the generalization error which is almost unbiased. Its major drawback rests in its time requirement. To overcome this difficulty, several upper bounds on the leave-one-out error of the pattern recognition SVM have been derived. Among those bounds, the most popular one is probably the radius-margin bound. It applies to the hard margin pattern recognition SVM, and by extension to the 2-norm SVM. In this report, we introduce a quadratic loss M-SVM, the M-SVM^2, as a direct extension of the 2-norm SVM to the multi-class case. For this machine, a generalized radius-margin bound is then established.",Machine Learning
7634,On Recovery of Sparse Signals via $\ell_1$ Minimization,"This article considers constrained $\ell_1$ minimization methods for the recovery of high dimensional sparse signals in three settings: noiseless, bounded error and Gaussian noise. A unified and elementary treatment is given in these noise settings for two $\ell_1$ minimization methods: the Dantzig selector and $\ell_1$ minimization with an $\ell_2$ constraint. The results of this paper improve the existing results in the literature by weakening the conditions and tightening the error bounds. The improvement on the conditions shows that signals with larger support can be recovered accurately. This paper also establishes connections between restricted isometry property and the mutual incoherence property. Some results of Candes, Romberg and Tao (2006) and Donoho, Elad, and Temlyakov (2006) are extended.",Machine Learning

Experiments comparing the Margitron with decomposition SVMs on tasks involving linear kernels and 2-norm soft margin are also reported.",Machine Learning
7636,Sample Selection Bias Correction Theory,This paper presents a theoretical analysis of sample selection bias correction. The sample bias correction technique commonly used in machine learning consists of reweighting the cost of an error on each training point of a biased sample to more closely reflect the unbiased distribution. This relies on weights derived by various estimation techniques based on finite samples. We analyze the effect of an error in that estimation on the accuracy of the hypothesis returned by the learning algorithm for two estimation techniques: a cluster-based estimation technique and kernel mean matching. We also report the results of sample bias correction experiments with several data sets using these techniques. Our analysis is based on the novel concept of distributional stability which generalizes the existing concept of point-based stability. Much of our work and proof techniques can be used to analyze other importance weighting techniques and their effect on accuracy when using a distributionally stable algorithm.,Machine Learning
7637,From Data Topology to a Modular Classifier,This article describes an approach to designing a distributed and modular neural classifier. This approach introduces a new hierarchical clustering that enables one to determine reliable regions in the representation space by exploiting supervised information. A multilayer perceptron is then associated with each of these detected clusters and charged with recognizing elements of the associated cluster while rejecting all others. The obtained global classifier is comprised of a set of cooperating neural networks and completed by a K-nearest neighbor classifier charged with treating elements rejected by all the neural networks. Experimental results for the handwritten digit recognition problem and comparison with neural and statistical nonmodular classifiers are given.,Machine Learning

7639,Statistical Learning of Arbitrary Computable Classifiers,"Statistical learning theory chiefly studies restricted hypothesis classes, particularly those with finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension. The fundamental quantity of interest is the sample complexity: the number of samples required to learn to a specified level of accuracy. Here we consider learning over the set of all computable labeling functions. Since the VC-dimension is infinite and a priori (uniform) bounds on the number of samples are impossible, we let the learning algorithm decide when it has seen sufficient samples to have learned. We first show that learning in this setting is indeed possible, and develop a learning algorithm. We then show, however, that bounding sample complexity independently of the distribution is impossible. Notably, this impossibility is entirely due to the requirement that the learning algorithm be computable, and not due to the statistical nature of the problem.",Machine Learning

In other words, there is an algorithm with the claimed running time that, given epsilon, delta > 0 and access to a random walk on {-1,+1}^n labeled by an arbitrary function f:{-1,+1}^n -> {-1,+1}, finds with probability at least 1-delta a k-junta that is (opt(f)+epsilon)-close to f, where opt(f) denotes the distance of a closest k-junta to f.",Machine Learning
7641,"Computationally Efficient Estimators for Dimension Reductions Using
  Stable Random Projections","The method of stable random projections is a tool for efficiently computing the $l_\alpha$ distances using low memory, where $0<\alpha \leq 2$ is a tuning parameter. The method boils down to a statistical estimation task and various estimators have been proposed, based on the geometric mean, the harmonic mean, and the fractional power etc.   This study proposes the optimal quantile estimator, whose main operation is selecting, which is considerably less expensive than taking fractional power, the main operation in previous estimators. Our experiments report that the optimal quantile estimator is nearly one order of magnitude more computationally efficient than previous estimators. For large-scale learning tasks in which storing and computing pairwise distances is a serious bottleneck, this estimator should be desirable.   In addition to its computational advantages, the optimal quantile estimator exhibits nice theoretical properties. It is more accurate than previous estimators when $\alpha>1$. We derive its theoretical error bounds and establish the explicit (i.e., no hidden constants) sample complexity bound.",Machine Learning
7642,On Approximating the Lp Distances for p>2,"Applications in machine learning and data mining require computing pairwise Lp distances in a data matrix A. For massive high-dimensional data, computing all pairwise distances of A can be infeasible. In fact, even storing A or all pairwise distances of A in the memory may be also infeasible. This paper proposes a simple method for p = 2, 4, 6, ... We first decompose the l_p (where p is even) distances into a sum of 2 marginal norms and p-1 ``inner products'' at different orders. Then we apply normal or sub-Gaussian random projections to approximate the resultant ``inner products,'' assuming that the marginal norms can be computed exactly by a linear scan. We propose two strategies for applying random projections. The basic projection strategy requires only one projection matrix but it is more difficult to analyze, while the alternative projection strategy requires p-1 projection matrices but its theoretical analysis is much easier. In terms of the accuracy, at least for p=4, the basic strategy is always more accurate than the alternative strategy if the data are non-negative, which is common in reality.",Machine Learning
7643,Graph Kernels,"We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which include the random walk graph kernel \citep{GaeFlaWro03,BorOngSchVisetal05}, marginalized graph kernel \citep{KasTsuIno03,KasTsuIno04,MahUedAkuPeretal04}, and geometric kernel on graphs \citep{Gaertner02}. Through extensions of linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) and reduction to a Sylvester equation, we construct an algorithm that improves the time complexity of kernel computation from $O(n^6)$ to $O(n^3)$. When the graphs are sparse, conjugate gradient solvers or fixed-point iterations bring our algorithm into the sub-cubic domain. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that it is often more than a thousand times faster than previous approaches. We then explore connections between diffusion kernels \citep{KonLaf02}, regularization on graphs \citep{SmoKon03}, and graph kernels, and use these connections to propose new graph kernels. Finally, we show that rational kernels \citep{CorHafMoh02,CorHafMoh03,CorHafMoh04} when specialized to graphs reduce to the random walk graph kernel.",Machine Learning
7644,"On Probability Distributions for Trees: Representations, Inference and
  Learning","We study probability distributions over free algebras of trees. Probability distributions can be seen as particular (formal power) tree series [Berstel et al 82, Esik et al 03], i.e. mappings from trees to a semiring K . A widely studied class of tree series is the class of rational (or recognizable) tree series which can be defined either in an algebraic way or by means of multiplicity tree automata. We argue that the algebraic representation is very convenient to model probability distributions over a free algebra of trees. First, as in the string case, the algebraic representation allows to design learning algorithms for the whole class of probability distributions defined by rational tree series. Note that learning algorithms for rational tree series correspond to learning algorithms for weighted tree automata where both the structure and the weights are learned. Second, the algebraic representation can be easily extended to deal with unranked trees (like XML trees where a symbol may have an unbounded number of children). Both properties are particularly relevant for applications: nondeterministic automata are required for the inference problem to be relevant (recall that Hidden Markov Models are equivalent to nondeterministic string automata); nowadays applications for Web Information Extraction, Web Services and document processing consider unranked trees.",Machine Learning
7645,"Positive factor networks: A graphical framework for modeling
  non-negative sequential data","We present a novel graphical framework for modeling non-negative sequential data with hierarchical structure. Our model corresponds to a network of coupled non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) modules, which we refer to as a positive factor network (PFN). The data model is linear, subject to non-negativity constraints, so that observation data consisting of an additive combination of individually representable observations is also representable by the network. This is a desirable property for modeling problems in computational auditory scene analysis, since distinct sound sources in the environment are often well-modeled as combining additively in the corresponding magnitude spectrogram. We propose inference and learning algorithms that leverage existing NMF algorithms and that are straightforward to implement. We present a target tracking example and provide results for synthetic observation data which serve to illustrate the interesting properties of PFNs and motivate their potential usefulness in applications such as music transcription, source separation, and speech recognition. We show how a target process characterized by a hierarchical state transition model can be represented as a PFN. Our results illustrate that a PFN which is defined in terms of a single target observation can then be used to effectively track the states of multiple simultaneous targets. Our results show that the quality of the inferred target states degrades gradually as the observation noise is increased. We also present results for an example in which meaningful hierarchical features are extracted from a spectrogram. Such a hierarchical representation could be useful for music transcription and source separation applications. We also propose a network for language modeling.",Machine Learning
7646,When is there a representer theorem? Vector versus matrix regularizers,"We consider a general class of regularization methods which learn a vector of parameters on the basis of linear measurements. It is well known that if the regularizer is a nondecreasing function of the inner product then the learned vector is a linear combination of the input data. This result, known as the {\em representer theorem}, is at the basis of kernel-based methods in machine learning. In this paper, we prove the necessity of the above condition, thereby completing the characterization of kernel methods based on regularization. We further extend our analysis to regularization methods which learn a matrix, a problem which is motivated by the application to multi-task learning. In this context, we study a more general representer theorem, which holds for a larger class of regularizers. We provide a necessary and sufficient condition for these class of matrix regularizers and highlight them with some concrete examples of practical importance. Our analysis uses basic principles from matrix theory, especially the useful notion of matrix nondecreasing function.",Machine Learning
7647,Clustered Multi-Task Learning: A Convex Formulation,"In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each task may benefit from the others. In the context of learning linear functions for supervised classification or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non convex methods dedicated to the same problem.",Machine Learning

We show the surprising fact that the class-conditional independence can be used to represent the original learning task in terms of 1) learning a classifier from $\mathcal{X}_2$ to $\mathcal{X}_1$ and 2) learning the class-conditional distribution of the feature set $\mathcal{X}_1$. This fact can be exploited for semi-supervised learning because the former task can be accomplished purely from unlabeled samples. We present experimental evaluation of the idea in two real world applications.",Machine Learning
7649,Learning Isometric Separation Maps,"Maximum Variance Unfolding (MVU) and its variants have been very successful in embedding data-manifolds in lower dimensional spaces, often revealing the true intrinsic dimension. In this paper we show how to also incorporate supervised class information into an MVU-like method without breaking its convexity. We call this method the Isometric Separation Map and we show that the resulting kernel matrix can be used as a binary/multiclass Support Vector Machine-like method in a semi-supervised (transductive) framework. We also show that the method always finds a kernel matrix that linearly separates the training data exactly without projecting them in infinite dimensional spaces. In traditional SVMs we choose a kernel and hope that the data become linearly separable in the kernel space. In this paper we show how the hyperplane can be chosen ad-hoc and the kernel is trained so that data are always linearly separable. Comparisons with Large Margin SVMs show comparable performance.",Machine Learning
7650,A Novel Clustering Algorithm Based on Quantum Random Walk,"The enormous successes have been made by quantum algorithms during the last decade. In this paper, we combine the quantum random walk (QRW) with the problem of data clustering, and develop two clustering algorithms based on the one dimensional QRW. Then, the probability distributions on the positions induced by QRW in these algorithms are investigated, which also indicates the possibility of obtaining better results. Consequently, the experimental results have demonstrated that data points in datasets are clustered reasonably and efficiently, and the clustering algorithms are of fast rates of convergence. Moreover, the comparison with other algorithms also provides an indication of the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",Machine Learning
7651,Convex Sparse Matrix Factorizations,"We present a convex formulation of dictionary learning for sparse signal decomposition. Convexity is obtained by replacing the usual explicit upper bound on the dictionary size by a convex rank-reducing term similar to the trace norm. In particular, our formulation introduces an explicit trade-off between size and sparsity of the decomposition of rectangular matrices. Using a large set of synthetic examples, we compare the estimation abilities of the convex and non-convex approaches, showing that while the convex formulation has a single local minimum, this may lead in some cases to performance which is inferior to the local minima of the non-convex formulation.",Machine Learning

The objective is to minimize the cumulative regret and Bayes risk. When the set of arms corresponds to the unit sphere, we prove that the regret and Bayes risk is of order $\Theta(r \sqrt{T})$, by establishing a lower bound for an arbitrary policy, and showing that a matching upper bound is obtained through a policy that alternates between exploration and exploitation phases. The phase-based policy is also shown to be effective if the set of arms satisfies a strong convexity condition. For the case of a general set of arms, we describe a near-optimal policy whose regret and Bayes risk admit upper bounds of the form $O(r \sqrt{T} \log^{3/2} T)$.",Machine Learning

7655,"Distributed Preemption Decisions: Probabilistic Graphical Model,
  Algorithm and Near-Optimality","Cooperative decision making is a vision of future network management and control. Distributed connection preemption is an important example where nodes can make intelligent decisions on allocating resources and controlling traffic flows for multi-class service networks. A challenge is that nodal decisions are spatially dependent as traffic flows trespass multiple nodes in a network. Hence the performance-complexity trade-off becomes important, i.e., how accurate decisions are versus how much information is exchanged among nodes. Connection preemption is known to be NP-complete. Centralized preemption is optimal but computationally intractable. Decentralized preemption is computationally efficient but may result in a poor performance. This work investigates distributed preemption where nodes decide whether and which flows to preempt using only local information exchange with neighbors. We develop, based on the probabilistic graphical models, a near-optimal distributed algorithm. The algorithm is used by each node to make collectively near-optimal preemption decisions. We study trade-offs between near-optimal performance and complexity that corresponds to the amount of information-exchange of the distributed algorithm. The algorithm is validated by both analysis and simulation.",Machine Learning

If Fisher information matrix at the true distribution is singular, then it has been left unknown what we can estimate about the true distribution from random samples. In this paper, we study a singular regression problem and prove a limit theorem which shows the relation between the singular regression problem and two birational invariants, a real log canonical threshold and a singular fluctuation. The obtained theorem has an important application to statistics, because it enables us to estimate the generalization error from the training error without any knowledge of the true probability distribution.",Machine Learning

Despite the stark differences between these learning schemes, we show that they yield the same communication accuracy in the realistic limits of large N and H, which coincides with the result of the classical occupancy problem of randomly assigning N objects to H words.",Machine Learning

7659,Database Transposition for Constrained (Closed) Pattern Mining,"Recently, different works proposed a new way to mine patterns in databases with pathological size. For example, experiments in genome biology usually provide databases with thousands of attributes (genes) but only tens of objects (experiments). In this case, mining the ""transposed"" database runs through a smaller search space, and the Galois connection allows to infer the closed patterns of the original database. We focus here on constrained pattern mining for those unusual databases and give a theoretical framework for database and constraint transposition. We discuss the properties of constraint transposition and look into classical constraints. We then address the problem of generating the closed patterns of the original database satisfying the constraint, starting from those mined in the ""transposed"" database. Finally, we show how to generate all the patterns satisfying the constraint from the closed ones.",Machine Learning

We develop a general theory for a variant of the popular error correcting output code scheme, using ideas from compressed sensing for exploiting this sparsity. The method can be regarded as a simple reduction from multi-label regression problems to binary regression problems. We show that the number of subproblems need only be logarithmic in the total number of possible labels, making this approach radically more efficient than others. We also state and prove robustness guarantees for this method in the form of regret transform bounds (in general), and also provide a more detailed analysis for the linear prediction setting.",Machine Learning

7662,Uniqueness of Low-Rank Matrix Completion by Rigidity Theory,"The problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a subset of its entries is often encountered in the analysis of incomplete data sets exhibiting an underlying factor model with applications in collaborative filtering, computer vision and control. Most recent work had been focused on constructing efficient algorithms for exact or approximate recovery of the missing matrix entries and proving lower bounds for the number of known entries that guarantee a successful recovery with high probability. A related problem from both the mathematical and algorithmic point of view is the distance geometry problem of realizing points in a Euclidean space from a given subset of their pairwise distances. Rigidity theory answers basic questions regarding the uniqueness of the realization satisfying a given partial set of distances. We observe that basic ideas and tools of rigidity theory can be adapted to determine uniqueness of low-rank matrix completion, where inner products play the role that distances play in rigidity theory. This observation leads to an efficient randomized algorithm for testing both local and global unique completion. Crucial to our analysis is a new matrix, which we call the completion matrix, that serves as the analogue of the rigidity matrix.",Machine Learning

The learner's goal is to perform better or not much worse than each expert, as evaluated by that expert, for all experts simultaneously. If the loss functions used by the experts are all proper scoring rules and all mixable, we show that the defensive forecasting algorithm enjoys the same performance guarantee as that attainable by the Aggregating Algorithm in the standard setting and known to be optimal. This result is also applied to the case of ""specialist"" (or ""sleeping"") experts. In this case, the defensive forecasting algorithm reduces to a simple modification of the Aggregating Algorithm.",Machine Learning

7665,Efficient Human Computation,"Collecting large labeled data sets is a laborious and expensive task, whose scaling up requires division of the labeling workload between many teachers. When the number of classes is large, miscorrespondences between the labels given by the different teachers are likely to occur, which, in the extreme case, may reach total inconsistency. In this paper we describe how globally consistent labels can be obtained, despite the absence of teacher coordination, and discuss the possible efficiency of this process in terms of human labor. We define a notion of label efficiency, measuring the ratio between the number of globally consistent labels obtained and the number of labels provided by distributed teachers. We show that the efficiency depends critically on the ratio alpha between the number of data instances seen by a single teacher, and the number of classes. We suggest several algorithms for the distributed labeling problem, and analyze their efficiency as a function of alpha. In addition, we provide an upper bound on label efficiency for the case of completely uncoordinated teachers, and show that efficiency approaches 0 as the ratio between the number of labels each teacher provides and the number of classes drops (i.e. alpha goes to 0).",Machine Learning

7669,Inferring Dynamic Bayesian Networks using Frequent Episode Mining,"Motivation: Several different threads of research have been proposed for modeling and mining temporal data. On the one hand, approaches such as dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a formal probabilistic basis to model relationships between time-indexed random variables but these models are intractable to learn in the general case. On the other, algorithms such as frequent episode mining are scalable to large datasets but do not exhibit the rigorous probabilistic interpretations that are the mainstay of the graphical models literature.   Results: We present a unification of these two seemingly diverse threads of research, by demonstrating how dynamic (discrete) Bayesian networks can be inferred from the results of frequent episode mining. This helps bridge the modeling emphasis of the former with the counting emphasis of the latter. First, we show how, under reasonable assumptions on data characteristics and on influences of random variables, the optimal DBN structure can be computed using a greedy, local, algorithm. Next, we connect the optimality of the DBN structure with the notion of fixed-delay episodes and their counts of distinct occurrences. Finally, to demonstrate the practical feasibility of our approach, we focus on a specific (but broadly applicable) class of networks, called excitatory networks, and show how the search for the optimal DBN structure can be conducted using just information from frequent episodes. Application on datasets gathered from mathematical models of spiking neurons as well as real neuroscience datasets are presented.

7671,"Limits of Learning about a Categorical Latent Variable under Prior
  Near-Ignorance","In this paper, we consider the coherent theory of (epistemic) uncertainty of Walley, in which beliefs are represented through sets of probability distributions, and we focus on the problem of modeling prior ignorance about a categorical random variable. In this setting, it is a known result that a state of prior ignorance is not compatible with learning. To overcome this problem, another state of beliefs, called \emph{near-ignorance}, has been proposed. Near-ignorance resembles ignorance very closely, by satisfying some principles that can arguably be regarded as necessary in a state of ignorance, and allows learning to take place. What this paper does, is to provide new and substantial evidence that also near-ignorance cannot be really regarded as a way out of the problem of starting statistical inference in conditions of very weak beliefs. The key to this result is focusing on a setting characterized by a variable of interest that is \emph{latent}. We argue that such a setting is by far the most common case in practice, and we provide, for the case of categorical latent variables (and general \emph{manifest} variables) a condition that, if satisfied, prevents learning to take place under prior near-ignorance. This condition is shown to be easily satisfied even in the most common statistical problems. We regard these results as a strong form of evidence against the possibility to adopt a condition of prior near-ignorance in real statistical problems.",Machine Learning

  automotive assembly lines","Engine assembly is a complex and heavily automated distributed-control process, with large amounts of faults data logged everyday. We describe an application of temporal data mining for analyzing fault logs in an engine assembly plant. Frequent episode discovery framework is a model-free method that can be used to deduce (temporal) correlations among events from the logs in an efficient manner. In addition to being theoretically elegant and computationally efficient, frequent episodes are also easy to interpret in the form actionable recommendations. Incorporation of domain-specific information is critical to successful application of the method for analyzing fault logs in the manufacturing domain. We show how domain-specific knowledge can be incorporated using heuristic rules that act as pre-filters and post-filters to frequent episode discovery. The system described here is currently being used in one of the engine assembly plants of General Motors and is planned for adaptation in other plants. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first real, large-scale application of temporal data mining in the manufacturing domain. We believe that the ideas presented in this paper can help practitioners engineer tools for analysis in other similar or related application domains as well.",Machine Learning

  Regular Case","Many learning machines that have hierarchical structure or hidden variables are now being used in information science, artificial intelligence, and bioinformatics. However, several learning machines used in such fields are not regular but singular statistical models, hence their generalization performance is still left unknown. To overcome these problems, in the previous papers, we proved new equations in statistical learning, by which we can estimate the Bayes generalization loss from the Bayes training loss and the functional variance, on the condition that the true distribution is a singularity contained in a learning machine. In this paper, we prove that the same equations hold even if a true distribution is not contained in a parametric model. Also we prove that, the proposed equations in a regular case are asymptotically equivalent to the Takeuchi information criterion. Therefore, the proposed equations are always applicable without any condition on the unknown true distribution.",Machine Learning

  Phylogeny","Clusters of genes that have evolved by repeated segmental duplication present difficult challenges throughout genomic analysis, from sequence assembly to functional analysis. Improved understanding of these clusters is of utmost importance, since they have been shown to be the source of evolutionary innovation, and have been linked to multiple diseases, including HIV and a variety of cancers. Previously, Zhang et al. (2008) developed an algorithm for reconstructing parsimonious evolutionary histories of such gene clusters, using only human genomic sequence data. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic model for the evolution of gene clusters on a phylogeny, and an MCMC algorithm for reconstruction of duplication histories from genomic sequences in multiple species. Several projects are underway to obtain high quality BAC-based assemblies of duplicated clusters in multiple species, and we anticipate that our method will be useful in analyzing these valuable new data sets.",Machine Learning

The problem is how to acquire the specific knowledge for a selected problem efficiently and effectively from human experts and encode it in the suitable computer format. Acquiring knowledge from human experts in the process of expert systems development is one of the most common problems cited till yet. This questionnaire was sent to 87 domain experts within all public and private universities in Pakistani. Among them 25 domain experts sent their valuable opinions. Most of the domain experts were highly qualified, well experienced and highly responsible persons.

  Prior","We develop a Bayesian framework for tackling the supervised clustering problem, the generic problem encountered in tasks such as reference matching, coreference resolution, identity uncertainty and record linkage. Our clustering model is based on the Dirichlet process prior, which enables us to define distributions over the countably infinite sets that naturally arise in this problem. We add supervision to our model by positing the existence of a set of unobserved random variables (we call these ""reference types"") that are generic across all clusters. Inference in our framework, which requires integrating over infinitely many parameters, is solved using Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. We present algorithms for both conjugate and non-conjugate priors. We present a simple--but general--parameterization of our model based on a Gaussian assumption. We evaluate this model on one artificial task and three real-world tasks, comparing it against both unsupervised and state-of-the-art supervised algorithms. Our results show that our model is able to outperform other models across a variety of tasks and performance metrics.",Machine Learning
7682,Fast search for Dirichlet process mixture models,"Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models provide a flexible Bayesian framework for density estimation. Unfortunately, their flexibility comes at a cost: inference in DP mixture models is computationally expensive, even when conjugate distributions are used. In the common case when one seeks only a maximum a posteriori assignment of data points to clusters, we show that search algorithms provide a practical alternative to expensive MCMC and variational techniques. When a true posterior sample is desired, the solution found by search can serve as a good initializer for MCMC. Experimental results show that using these techniques is it possible to apply DP mixture models to very large data sets.",Machine Learning

Recent work has shown that the cellular simultaneous recurrent neural network (CSRN) can solve this problem for simple mazes. This thesis focuses on exploiting relevant information about the maze to improve learning and decrease the training time for the CSRN to solve mazes. Appropriate variables are identified to create useful clusters using relevant information. The CSRN was next modified to allow for an additional external input. With this additional input, several methods were tested and results show that clustering the mazes improves the overall learning of the traversal problem for the CSRN.",Machine Learning

This estimate of combinatorial dimension is used to derive an iterative algorithm, called RandSVM, which at each step calls an existing solver to train SVMs on a randomly chosen subset of size $O({log} n)$. The algorithm has probabilistic guarantees and is capable of training SVMs with Kernels for both classification and regression problems. Experiments done on synthetic and real life data sets demonstrate that the algorithm scales up existing SVM learners, without loss of accuracy.",Machine Learning

7687,"Variable sigma Gaussian processes: An expectation propagation
  perspective","Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a probabilistic nonparametric representation of functions in regression, classification, and other problems. Unfortunately, exact learning with GPs is intractable for large datasets. A variety of approximate GP methods have been proposed that essentially map the large dataset into a small set of basis points. The most advanced of these, the variable-sigma GP (VSGP) (Walder et al., 2008), allows each basis point to have its own length scale. However, VSGP was only derived for regression. We describe how VSGP can be applied to classification and other problems, by deriving it as an expectation propagation algorithm. In this view, sparse GP approximations correspond to a KL-projection of the true posterior onto a compact exponential family of GPs. VSGP constitutes one such family, and we show how to enlarge this family to get additional accuracy. In particular, we show that endowing each basis point with its own full covariance matrix provides a significant increase in approximation power.",Machine Learning

The resulting anomaly detector is shown to be asymptotically optimal in that it is uniformly most powerful for the specified false alarm level, $\alpha$, for the case when the anomaly density is a mixture of the nominal and a known density. Our algorithm is computationally efficient, being linear in dimension and quadratic in data size. It does not require choosing complicated tuning parameters or function approximation classes and it can adapt to local structure such as local change in dimensionality. We demonstrate the algorithm on both artificial and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces.",Machine Learning
7691,"A Mirroring Theorem and its Application to a New Method of Unsupervised
  Hierarchical Pattern Classification","In this paper, we prove a crucial theorem called Mirroring Theorem which affirms that given a collection of samples with enough information in it such that it can be classified into classes and subclasses then (i) There exists a mapping which classifies and subclassifies these samples (ii) There exists a hierarchical classifier which can be constructed by using Mirroring Neural Networks (MNNs) in combination with a clustering algorithm that can approximate this mapping. Thus, the proof of the Mirroring theorem provides a theoretical basis for the existence and a practical feasibility of constructing hierarchical classifiers, given the maps. Our proposed Mirroring Theorem can also be considered as an extension to Kolmogrovs theorem in providing a realistic solution for unsupervised classification. The techniques we develop, are general in nature and have led to the construction of learning machines which are (i) tree like in structure, (ii) modular (iii) with each module running on a common algorithm (tandem algorithm) and (iv) selfsupervised. We have actually built the architecture, developed the tandem algorithm of such a hierarchical classifier and demonstrated it on an example problem.",Machine Learning
7692,"Sequential anomaly detection in the presence of noise and limited
  feedback","This paper describes a methodology for detecting anomalies from sequentially observed and potentially noisy data. The proposed approach consists of two main elements: (1) {\em filtering}, or assigning a belief or likelihood to each successive measurement based upon our ability to predict it from previous noisy observations, and (2) {\em hedging}, or flagging potential anomalies by comparing the current belief against a time-varying and data-adaptive threshold. The threshold is adjusted based on the available feedback from an end user. Our algorithms, which combine universal prediction with recent work on online convex programming, do not require computing posterior distributions given all current observations and involve simple primal-dual parameter updates. At the heart of the proposed approach lie exponential-family models which can be used in a wide variety of contexts and applications, and which yield methods that achieve sublinear per-round regret against both static and slowly varying product distributions with marginals drawn from the same exponential family. Moreover, the regret against static distributions coincides with the minimax value of the corresponding online strongly convex game. We also prove bounds on the number of mistakes made during the hedging step relative to the best offline choice of the threshold with access to all estimated beliefs and feedback signals. We validate the theory on synthetic data drawn from a time-varying distribution over binary vectors of high dimensionality, as well as on the Enron email dataset.",Machine Learning

7695,Learning Mixtures of Gaussians using the k-means Algorithm,"One of the most popular algorithms for clustering in Euclidean space is the $k$-means algorithm; $k$-means is difficult to analyze mathematically, and few theoretical guarantees are known about it, particularly when the data is {\em well-clustered}. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap in the literature by analyzing the behavior of $k$-means on well-clustered data. In particular, we study the case when each cluster is distributed as a different Gaussian -- or, in other words, when the input comes from a mixture of Gaussians.   We analyze three aspects of the $k$-means algorithm under this assumption. First, we show that when the input comes from a mixture of two spherical Gaussians, a variant of the 2-means algorithm successfully isolates the subspace containing the means of the mixture components. Second, we show an exact expression for the convergence of our variant of the 2-means algorithm, when the input is a very large number of samples from a mixture of spherical Gaussians. Our analysis does not require any lower bound on the separation between the mixture components.   Finally, we study the sample requirement of $k$-means; for a mixture of 2 spherical Gaussians, we show an upper bound on the number of samples required by a variant of 2-means to get close to the true solution. The sample requirement grows with increasing dimensionality of the data, and decreasing separation between the means of the Gaussians. To match our upper bound, we show an information-theoretic lower bound on any algorithm that learns mixtures of two spherical Gaussians; our lower bound indicates that in the case when the overlap between the probability masses of the two distributions is small, the sample requirement of $k$-means is {\em near-optimal}.",Machine Learning

There are $K$ queues at the base station for the downlink traffic to the $K$ mobiles with heterogeneous packet arrivals and delay requirements. We shall model the problem as a $K$-dimensional infinite horizon average reward Markov Decision Problem (MDP) where the control actions are assumed to be a function of the instantaneous Channel State Information (CSI) as well as the joint Queue State Information (QSI). This problem is challenging because it corresponds to a stochastic Network Utility Maximization (NUM) problem where general solution is still unknown. We propose an {\em online stochastic value iteration} solution using {\em stochastic approximation}. The proposed power control algorithm, which is a function of both the CSI and the QSI, takes the form of multi-level water-filling. We prove that under two mild conditions in Theorem 1 (One is the stepsize condition. The other is the condition on accessibility of the Markov Chain, which can be easily satisfied in most of the cases we are interested.), the proposed solution converges to the optimal solution almost surely (with probability 1) and the proposed framework offers a possible solution to the general stochastic NUM problem. By exploiting the birth-death structure of the queue dynamics, we obtain a reduced complexity decomposed solution with linear $\mathcal{O}(KN_F)$ complexity and $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory requirement.",Machine Learning

(d) The use of SVM classifier. The enhancement can be defined as conversion of the image quality to a better and more understandable level. The mammogram enhancement procedure includes filtering, top hat operation, DWT. Then the contrast stretching is used to increase the contrast of the image. The segmentation of mammogram images has been playing an important role to improve the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. The most common segmentation method used is thresholding.

We formalize this task as a multi-armed bandit problem, where the payoff function is either sampled from a Gaussian process (GP) or has low RKHS norm. We resolve the important open problem of deriving regret bounds for this setting, which imply novel convergence rates for GP optimization. We analyze GP-UCB, an intuitive upper-confidence based algorithm, and bound its cumulative regret in terms of maximal information gain, establishing a novel connection between GP optimization and experimental design. Moreover, by bounding the latter in terms of operator spectra, we obtain explicit sublinear regret bounds for many commonly used covariance functions. In some important cases, our bounds have surprisingly weak dependence on the dimensionality. In our experiments on real sensor data, GP-UCB compares favorably with other heuristical GP optimization approaches.",Machine Learning
7701,Optimal Query Complexity for Reconstructing Hypergraphs,"In this paper we consider the problem of reconstructing a hidden weighted hypergraph of constant rank using additive queries. We prove the following: Let $G$ be a weighted hidden hypergraph of constant rank with n vertices and $m$ hyperedges. For any $m$ there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the edges of the graph and their weights using $$ O(\frac{m\log n}{\log m}) $$ additive queries. This solves the open problem in [S. Choi, J. H. Kim. Optimal Query Complexity Bounds for Finding Graphs. {\em STOC}, 749--758,~2008].   When the weights of the hypergraph are integers that are less than $O(poly(n^d/m))$ where $d$ is the rank of the hypergraph (and therefore for unweighted hypergraphs) there exists a non-adaptive algorithm that finds the edges of the graph and their weights using $$ O(\frac{m\log \frac{n^d}{m}}{\log m}). $$ additive queries.

We kernelize one of the algorithms and prove theoretical guarantees on its loss. We perform experiments and compare our algorithms with logistic regression.,Machine Learning
7703,Measuring Latent Causal Structure,"Discovering latent representations of the observed world has become increasingly more relevant in data analysis. Much of the effort concentrates on building latent variables which can be used in prediction problems, such as classification and regression. A related goal of learning latent structure from data is that of identifying which hidden common causes generate the observations, such as in applications that require predicting the effect of policies. This will be the main problem tackled in our contribution: given a dataset of indicators assumed to be generated by unknown and unmeasured common causes, we wish to discover which hidden common causes are those, and how they generate our data. This is possible under the assumption that observed variables are linear functions of the latent causes with additive noise. Previous results in the literature present solutions for the case where each observed variable is a noisy function of a single latent variable. We show how to extend the existing results for some cases where observed variables measure more than one latent variable.",Machine Learning

Recently, it was discovered that the asymptotic learning curves in Bayes estimation are subject to a universal law, even if the log likelihood function can not be approximated by any quadratic form. However, it is left unknown what mathematical property ensures such a universal law. In this paper, we define a renormalizable condition of the statistical estimation problem, and show that, under such a condition, the asymptotic learning curves are ensured to be subject to the universal law, even if the true distribution is unrealizable and singular for a statistical model. Also we study a nonrenormalizable case, in which the learning curves have the different asymptotic behaviors from the universal law.",Machine Learning

7706,Trajectory Clustering and an Application to Airspace Monitoring,"This paper presents a framework aimed at monitoring the behavior of aircraft in a given airspace. Nominal trajectories are determined and learned using data driven methods. Standard procedures are used by air traffic controllers (ATC) to guide aircraft, ensure the safety of the airspace, and to maximize the runway occupancy. Even though standard procedures are used by ATC, the control of the aircraft remains with the pilots, leading to a large variability in the flight patterns observed. Two methods to identify typical operations and their variability from recorded radar tracks are presented. This knowledge base is then used to monitor the conformance of current operations against operations previously identified as standard. A tool called AirTrajectoryMiner is presented, aiming at monitoring the instantaneous health of the airspace, in real time. The airspace is ""healthy"" when all aircraft are flying according to the nominal procedures. A measure of complexity is introduced, measuring the conformance of current flight to nominal flight patterns. When an aircraft does not conform, the complexity increases as more attention from ATC is required to ensure a safe separation between aircraft.",Machine Learning

As this academic performance is influenced by many factors, it is essential to develop predictive data mining model for students' performance so as to identify the slow learners and study the influence of the dominant factors on their academic performance. In the present investigation, a survey cum experimental methodology was adopted to generate a database and it was constructed from a primary and a secondary source. While the primary data was collected from the regular students, the secondary data was gathered from the school and office of the Chief Educational Officer (CEO). A total of 1000 datasets of the year 2006 from five different schools in three different districts of Tamilnadu were collected. The raw data was preprocessed in terms of filling up missing values, transforming values in one form into another and relevant attribute/ variable selection. As a result, we had 772 student records, which were used for CHAID prediction model construction.

7710,Online Distributed Sensor Selection,"A key problem in sensor networks is to decide which sensors to query when, in order to obtain the most useful information (e.g., for performing accurate prediction), subject to constraints (e.g., on power and bandwidth). In many applications the utility function is not known a priori, must be learned from data, and can even change over time. Furthermore for large sensor networks solving a centralized optimization problem to select sensors is not feasible, and thus we seek a fully distributed solution. In this paper, we present Distributed Online Greedy (DOG), an efficient, distributed algorithm for repeatedly selecting sensors online, only receiving feedback about the utility of the selected sensors. We prove very strong theoretical no-regret guarantees that apply whenever the (unknown) utility function satisfies a natural diminishing returns property called submodularity. Our algorithm has extremely low communication requirements, and scales well to large sensor deployments. We extend DOG to allow observation-dependent sensor selection. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on several real-world sensing tasks.",Machine Learning

Kutin and Niyogi proved that ERM on finite hypothesis spaces containing a unique risk minimizer has training stability that scales exponentially with sample size, and conjectured that the existence of multiple risk minimizers prevents even super-quadratic convergence. We prove this result for the strictly weaker notion of CV-stability, positively resolving the conjecture.",Machine Learning
7712,"Collaborative Filtering in a Non-Uniform World: Learning with the
  Weighted Trace Norm",We show that matrix completion with trace-norm regularization can be significantly hurt when entries of the matrix are sampled non-uniformly. We introduce a weighted version of the trace-norm regularizer that works well also with non-uniform sampling. Our experimental results demonstrate that the weighted trace-norm regularization indeed yields significant gains on the (highly non-uniformly sampled) Netflix dataset.,Machine Learning
7713,Interactive Submodular Set Cover,We introduce a natural generalization of submodular set cover and exact active learning with a finite hypothesis class (query learning). We call this new problem interactive submodular set cover. Applications include advertising in social networks with hidden information. We give an approximation guarantee for a novel greedy algorithm and give a hardness of approximation result which matches up to constant factors. We also discuss negative results for simpler approaches and present encouraging early experimental results.,Machine Learning
7714,"Word level Script Identification from Bangla and Devanagri Handwritten
  Texts mixed with Roman Script","India is a multi-lingual country where Roman script is often used alongside different Indic scripts in a text document. To develop a script specific handwritten Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system, it is therefore necessary to identify the scripts of handwritten text correctly. In this paper, we present a system, which automatically separates the scripts of handwritten words from a document, written in Bangla or Devanagri mixed with Roman scripts. In this script separation technique, we first, extract the text lines and words from document pages using a script independent Neighboring Component Analysis technique. Then we have designed a Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) based classifier for script separation, trained with 8 different wordlevel holistic features. Two equal sized datasets, one with Bangla and Roman scripts and the other with Devanagri and Roman scripts, are prepared for the system evaluation. On respective independent text samples, word-level script identification accuracies of 99.29% and 98.43% are achieved.",Machine Learning
7715,Contextual Bandit Algorithms with Supervised Learning Guarantees,"We address the problem of learning in an online, bandit setting where the learner must repeatedly select among $K$ actions, but only receives partial feedback based on its choices. We establish two new facts: First, using a new algorithm called Exp4.P, we show that it is possible to compete with the best in a set of $N$ experts with probability $1-\delta$ while incurring regret at most $O(\sqrt{KT\ln(N/\delta)})$ over $T$ time steps. The new algorithm is tested empirically in a large-scale, real-world dataset. Second, we give a new algorithm called VE that competes with a possibly infinite set of policies of VC-dimension $d$ while incurring regret at most $O(\sqrt{T(d\ln(T) + \ln (1/\delta))})$ with probability $1-\delta$. These guarantees improve on those of all previous algorithms, whether in a stochastic or adversarial environment, and bring us closer to providing supervised learning type guarantees for the contextual bandit setting.",Machine Learning
7716,Adaptive Bound Optimization for Online Convex Optimization,"We introduce a new online convex optimization algorithm that adaptively chooses its regularization function based on the loss functions observed so far. This is in contrast to previous algorithms that use a fixed regularization function such as L2-squared, and modify it only via a single time-dependent parameter. Our algorithm's regret bounds are worst-case optimal, and for certain realistic classes of loss functions they are much better than existing bounds. These bounds are problem-dependent, which means they can exploit the structure of the actual problem instance. Critically, however, our algorithm does not need to know this structure in advance. Rather, we prove competitive guarantees that show the algorithm provides a bound within a constant factor of the best possible bound (of a certain functional form) in hindsight.",Machine Learning
7717,Asymptotic Analysis of Generative Semi-Supervised Learning,"Semisupervised learning has emerged as a popular framework for improving modeling accuracy while controlling labeling cost. Based on an extension of stochastic composite likelihood we quantify the asymptotic accuracy of generative semi-supervised learning. In doing so, we complement distribution-free analysis by providing an alternative framework to measure the value associated with different labeling policies and resolve the fundamental question of how much data to label and in what manner. We demonstrate our approach with both simulation studies and real world experiments using naive Bayes for text classification and MRFs and CRFs for structured prediction in NLP.",Machine Learning
7718,"Unsupervised Supervised Learning II: Training Margin Based Classifiers
  without Labels","Many popular linear classifiers, such as logistic regression, boosting, or SVM, are trained by optimizing a margin-based risk function. Traditionally, these risk functions are computed based on a labeled dataset. We develop a novel technique for estimating such risks using only unlabeled data and the marginal label distribution. We prove that the proposed risk estimator is consistent on high-dimensional datasets and demonstrate it on synthetic and real-world data. In particular, we show how the estimate is used for evaluating classifiers in transfer learning, and for training classifiers with no labeled data whatsoever.",Machine Learning
7719,Model Selection with the Loss Rank Principle,"A key issue in statistics and machine learning is to automatically select the ""right"" model complexity, e.g., the number of neighbors to be averaged over in k nearest neighbor (kNN) regression or the polynomial degree in regression with polynomials. We suggest a novel principle - the Loss Rank Principle (LoRP) - for model selection in regression and classification. It is based on the loss rank, which counts how many other (fictitious) data would be fitted better. LoRP selects the model that has minimal loss rank. Unlike most penalized maximum likelihood variants (AIC, BIC, MDL), LoRP depends only on the regression functions and the loss function. It works without a stochastic noise model, and is directly applicable to any non-parametric regressor, like kNN.",Machine Learning
7720,"Statistical and Computational Tradeoffs in Stochastic Composite
  Likelihood","Maximum likelihood estimators are often of limited practical use due to the intensive computation they require. We propose a family of alternative estimators that maximize a stochastic variation of the composite likelihood function. Each of the estimators resolve the computation-accuracy tradeoff differently, and taken together they span a continuous spectrum of computation-accuracy tradeoff resolutions. We prove the consistency of the estimators, provide formulas for their asymptotic variance, statistical robustness, and computational complexity. We discuss experimental results in the context of Boltzmann machines and conditional random fields. The theoretical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the estimators when the computational resources are insufficient. They also demonstrate that in some cases reduced computational complexity is associated with robustness thereby increasing statistical accuracy.",Machine Learning
7721,Exponential Family Hybrid Semi-Supervised Learning,We present an approach to semi-supervised learning based on an exponential family characterization. Our approach generalizes previous work on coupled priors for hybrid generative/discriminative models. Our model is more flexible and natural than previous approaches. Experimental results on several data sets show that our approach also performs better in practice.,Machine Learning
7722,"A New Clustering Approach based on Page's Path Similarity for Navigation
  Patterns Mining","In recent years, predicting the user's next request in web navigation has received much attention. An information source to be used for dealing with such problem is the left information by the previous web users stored at the web access log on the web servers. Purposed systems for this problem work based on this idea that if a large number of web users request specific pages of a website on a given session, it can be concluded that these pages are satisfying similar information needs, and therefore they are conceptually related. In this study, a new clustering approach is introduced that employs logical path storing of a website pages as another parameter which is regarded as a similarity parameter and conceptual relation between web pages. The results of simulation have shown that the proposed approach is more than others precise in determining the clusters.",Machine Learning
7723,"Hierarchical Web Page Classification Based on a Topic Model and
  Neighboring Pages Integration","Most Web page classification models typically apply the bag of words (BOW) model to represent the feature space. The original BOW representation, however, is unable to recognize semantic relationships between terms. One possible solution is to apply the topic model approach based on the Latent Dirichlet Allocation algorithm to cluster the term features into a set of latent topics. Terms assigned into the same topic are semantically related. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical classification method based on a topic model and by integrating additional term features from neighboring pages. Our hierarchical classification method consists of two phases: (1) feature representation by using a topic model and integrating neighboring pages, and (2) hierarchical Support Vector Machines (SVM) classification model constructed from a confusion matrix. From the experimental results, the approach of using the proposed hierarchical SVM model by integrating current page with neighboring pages via the topic model yielded the best performance with the accuracy equal to 90.33% and the F1 measure of 90.14%; an improvement of 5.12% and 5.13% over the original SVM model, respectively.",Machine Learning
7724,Supermartingales in Prediction with Expert Advice,"We apply the method of defensive forecasting, based on the use of game-theoretic supermartingales, to prediction with expert advice. In the traditional setting of a countable number of experts and a finite number of outcomes, the Defensive Forecasting Algorithm is very close to the well-known Aggregating Algorithm. Not only the performance guarantees but also the predictions are the same for these two methods of fundamentally different nature. We discuss also a new setting where the experts can give advice conditional on the learner's future decision. Both the algorithms can be adapted to the new setting and give the same performance guarantees as in the traditional setting. Finally, we outline an application of defensive forecasting to a setting with several loss functions.",Machine Learning
7725,State-Space Dynamics Distance for Clustering Sequential Data,"This paper proposes a novel similarity measure for clustering sequential data. We first construct a common state-space by training a single probabilistic model with all the sequences in order to get a unified representation for the dataset. Then, distances are obtained attending to the transition matrices induced by each sequence in that state-space. This approach solves some of the usual overfitting and scalability issues of the existing semi-parametric techniques, that rely on training a model for each sequence. Empirical studies on both synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the advantages of the proposed similarity measure for clustering sequences.",Machine Learning
7726,"Asymptotic Equivalence of Bayes Cross Validation and Widely Applicable
  Information Criterion in Singular Learning Theory","In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to $2\lambda/n$, where $\lambda$ is the real log canonical threshold and $n$ is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.",Machine Learning
7727,Generation and Interpretation of Temporal Decision Rules,"We present a solution to the problem of understanding a system that produces a sequence of temporally ordered observations. Our solution is based on generating and interpreting a set of temporal decision rules. A temporal decision rule is a decision rule that can be used to predict or retrodict the value of a decision attribute, using condition attributes that are observed at times other than the decision attribute's time of observation. A rule set, consisting of a set of temporal decision rules with the same decision attribute, can be interpreted by our Temporal Investigation Method for Enregistered Record Sequences (TIMERS) to signify an instantaneous, an acausal or a possibly causal relationship between the condition attributes and the decision attribute. We show the effectiveness of our method, by describing a number of experiments with both synthetic and real temporal data.",Machine Learning

We present a detailed study of Bregman Distance minimization, a family of generalized entropy measures associated with convex functions. We convert the L1-regularized logistic regression into this more general framework and propose a primal-dual method based algorithm for learning the parameters. We pose L1-regularized logistic regression into Bregman distance minimization and then apply non-linear constrained optimization techniques to estimate the parameters of the logistic model.",Machine Learning
7729,Efficient Learning with Partially Observed Attributes,"We describe and analyze efficient algorithms for learning a linear predictor from examples when the learner can only view a few attributes of each training example. This is the case, for instance, in medical research, where each patient participating in the experiment is only willing to go through a small number of tests. Our analysis bounds the number of additional examples sufficient to compensate for the lack of full information on each training example. We demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithms by showing that when running on digit recognition data, they obtain a high prediction accuracy even when the learner gets to see only four pixels of each image.",Machine Learning
7730,The Latent Bernoulli-Gauss Model for Data Analysis,"We present a new latent-variable model employing a Gaussian mixture integrated with a feature selection procedure (the Bernoulli part of the model) which together form a ""Latent Bernoulli-Gauss"" distribution.

In particular, we consider the problem where the signals are contaminated by noise or may present some dephasing with respect to their labels. For that, we propose to jointly learn a SVM sample classifier with a temporal filtering of the channels. This will lead to a large margin filtering that is adapted to the specificity of each channel (noise and time-lag). We derive algorithms to solve the optimization problem and we discuss different filter regularizations for automated scaling or selection of channels. Our approach is tested on a non-linear toy example and on a BCI dataset. Results show that the classification performance on these problems can be improved by learning a large margin filtering.",Machine Learning

  under fixed input distributions","We show that the learning sample complexity of a sigmoidal neural network constructed by Sontag (1992) required to achieve a given misclassification error under a fixed purely atomic distribution can grow arbitrarily fast: for any prescribed rate of growth there is an input distribution having this rate as the sample complexity, and the bound is asymptotically tight. The rate can be superexponential, a non-recursive function, etc. We further observe that Sontag's ANN is not Glivenko-Cantelli under any input distribution having a non-atomic part.",Machine Learning
7733,Reinforcement Learning via AIXI Approximation,"This paper introduces a principled approach for the design of a scalable general reinforcement learning agent. This approach is based on a direct approximation of AIXI, a Bayesian optimality notion for general reinforcement learning agents. Previously, it has been unclear whether the theory of AIXI could motivate the design of practical algorithms. We answer this hitherto open question in the affirmative, by providing the first computationally feasible approximation to the AIXI agent. To develop our approximation, we introduce a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm along with an agent-specific extension of the Context Tree Weighting algorithm. Empirically, we present a set of encouraging results on a number of stochastic, unknown, and partially observable domains.",Machine Learning
7734,Adapting to the Shifting Intent of Search Queries,"Search engines today present results that are often oblivious to abrupt shifts in intent. For example, the query `independence day' usually refers to a US holiday, but the intent of this query abruptly changed during the release of a major film by that name. While no studies exactly quantify the magnitude of intent-shifting traffic, studies suggest that news events, seasonal topics, pop culture, etc account for 50% of all search queries. This paper shows that the signals a search engine receives can be used to both determine that a shift in intent has happened, as well as find a result that is now more relevant. We present a meta-algorithm that marries a classifier with a bandit algorithm to achieve regret that depends logarithmically on the number of query impressions, under certain assumptions. We provide strong evidence that this regret is close to the best achievable. Finally, via a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms prior approaches, particularly as the amount of intent-shifting traffic increases.",Machine Learning

Support Vector Machine (SVM) and back propagation neural (BPN) network has been applied successfully in many areas with excellent generalization results, such as rule extraction, classification and evaluation. In this paper, a model based on SVM with Gaussian RBF kernel is proposed here for enterprise financial distress evaluation. BPN network is considered one of the simplest and are most general methods used for supervised training of multilayered neural network. The comparative results show that through the difference between the performance measures is marginal; SVM gives higher precision and lower error rates.",Machine Learning
7736,Close Clustering Based Automated Color Image Annotation,"Most image-search approaches today are based on the text based tags associated with the images which are mostly human generated and are subject to various kinds of errors. The results of a query to the image database thus can often be misleading and may not satisfy the requirements of the user. In this work we propose our approach to automate this tagging process of images, where image results generated can be fine filtered based on a probabilistic tagging mechanism. We implement a tool which helps to automate the tagging process by maintaining a training database, wherein the system is trained to identify certain set of input images, the results generated from which are used to create a probabilistic tagging mechanism. Given a certain set of segments in an image it calculates the probability of presence of particular keywords. This probability table is further used to generate the candidate tags for input images.",Machine Learning
7737,"Bounded Coordinate-Descent for Biological Sequence Classification in
  High Dimensional Predictor Space","We present a framework for discriminative sequence classification where the learner works directly in the high dimensional predictor space of all subsequences in the training set. This is possible by employing a new coordinate-descent algorithm coupled with bounding the magnitude of the gradient for selecting discriminative subsequences fast. We characterize the loss functions for which our generic learning algorithm can be applied and present concrete implementations for logistic regression (binomial log-likelihood loss) and support vector machines (squared hinge loss). Application of our algorithm to protein remote homology detection and remote fold recognition results in performance comparable to that of state-of-the-art methods (e.g., kernel support vector machines). Unlike state-of-the-art classifiers, the resulting classification models are simply lists of weighted discriminative subsequences and can thus be interpreted and related to the biological problem.",Machine Learning
7738,Semi-Supervised Kernel PCA,"We present three generalisations of Kernel Principal Components Analysis (KPCA) which incorporate knowledge of the class labels of a subset of the data points. The first, MV-KPCA, penalises within class variances similar to Fisher discriminant analysis. The second, LSKPCA is a hybrid of least squares regression and kernel PCA. The final LR-KPCA is an iteratively reweighted version of the previous which achieves a sigmoid loss function on the labeled points. We provide a theoretical risk bound as well as illustrative experiments on real and toy data sets.",Machine Learning
7739,"Online Learning in Case of Unbounded Losses Using the Follow Perturbed
  Leader Algorithm",In this paper the sequential prediction problem with expert advice is considered for the case where losses of experts suffered at each step cannot be bounded in advance. We present some modification of Kalai and Vempala algorithm of following the perturbed leader where weights depend on past losses of the experts. New notions of a volume and a scaled fluctuation of a game are introduced. We present a probabilistic algorithm protected from unrestrictedly large one-step losses. This algorithm has the optimal performance in the case when the scaled fluctuations of one-step losses of experts of the pool tend to zero.,Machine Learning
7740,Switching between Hidden Markov Models using Fixed Share,"In prediction with expert advice the goal is to design online prediction algorithms that achieve small regret (additional loss on the whole data) compared to a reference scheme. In the simplest such scheme one compares to the loss of the best expert in hindsight. A more ambitious goal is to split the data into segments and compare to the best expert on each segment. This is appropriate if the nature of the data changes between segments. The standard fixed-share algorithm is fast and achieves small regret compared to this scheme.   Fixed share treats the experts as black boxes: there are no assumptions about how they generate their predictions. But if the experts are learning, the following question arises: should the experts learn from all data or only from data in their own segment? The original algorithm naturally addresses the first case. Here we consider the second option, which is more appropriate exactly when the nature of the data changes between segments. In general extending fixed share to this second case will slow it down by a factor of T on T outcomes. We show, however, that no such slowdown is necessary if the experts are hidden Markov models.",Machine Learning
7741,"Freezing and Sleeping: Tracking Experts that Learn by Evolving Past
  Posteriors","A problem posed by Freund is how to efficiently track a small pool of experts out of a much larger set. This problem was solved when Bousquet and Warmuth introduced their mixing past posteriors (MPP) algorithm in 2001.   In Freund's problem the experts would normally be considered black boxes. However, in this paper we re-examine Freund's problem in case the experts have internal structure that enables them to learn. In this case the problem has two possible interpretations: should the experts learn from all data or only from the subsequence on which they are being tracked? The MPP algorithm solves the first case. Our contribution is to generalise MPP to address the second option. The results we obtain apply to any expert structure that can be formalised using (expert) hidden Markov models. Curiously enough, for our interpretation there are \emph{two} natural reference schemes: freezing and sleeping. For each scheme, we provide an efficient prediction strategy and prove the relevant loss bound.",Machine Learning

7743,Fast Overlapping Group Lasso,"The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predefined) non-overlapping groups of features. The non-overlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation, where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efficient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. We have performed empirical evaluations using the breast cancer gene expression data set, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",Machine Learning
7744,Reinforcement Learning by Comparing Immediate Reward,"This paper introduces an approach to Reinforcement Learning Algorithm by comparing their immediate rewards using a variation of Q-Learning algorithm. Unlike the conventional Q-Learning, the proposed algorithm compares current reward with immediate reward of past move and work accordingly. Relative reward based Q-learning is an approach towards interactive learning. Q-Learning is a model free reinforcement learning method that used to learn the agents. It is observed that under normal circumstances algorithm take more episodes to reach optimal Q-value due to its normal reward or sometime negative reward. In this new form of algorithm agents select only those actions which have a higher immediate reward signal in comparison to previous one. The contribution of this article is the presentation of new Q-Learning Algorithm in order to maximize the performance of algorithm and reduce the number of episode required to reach optimal Q-value. Effectiveness of proposed algorithm is simulated in a 20 x20 Grid world deterministic environment and the result for the two forms of Q-Learning Algorithms is given.",Machine Learning
7745,"A Unified View of Regularized Dual Averaging and Mirror Descent with
  Implicit Updates","We study three families of online convex optimization algorithms: follow-the-proximally-regularized-leader (FTRL-Proximal), regularized dual averaging (RDA), and composite-objective mirror descent. We first prove equivalence theorems that show all of these algorithms are instantiations of a general FTRL update. This provides theoretical insight on previous experimental observations. In particular, even though the FOBOS composite mirror descent algorithm handles L1 regularization explicitly, it has been observed that RDA is even more effective at producing sparsity. Our results demonstrate that FOBOS uses subgradient approximations to the L1 penalty from previous rounds, leading to less sparsity than RDA, which handles the cumulative penalty in closed form. The FTRL-Proximal algorithm can be seen as a hybrid of these two, and outperforms both on a large, real-world dataset.   Our second contribution is a unified analysis which produces regret bounds that match (up to logarithmic terms) or improve the best previously known bounds. This analysis also extends these algorithms in two important ways: we support a more general type of composite objective and we analyze implicit updates, which replace the subgradient approximation of the current loss function with an exact optimization.",Machine Learning
7746,Conditional Random Fields and Support Vector Machines: A Hybrid Approach,"We propose a novel hybrid loss for multiclass and structured prediction problems that is a convex combination of log loss for Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) and a multiclass hinge loss for Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We provide a sufficient condition for when the hybrid loss is Fisher consistent for classification. This condition depends on a measure of dominance between labels - specifically, the gap in per observation probabilities between the most likely labels. We also prove Fisher consistency is necessary for parametric consistency when learning models such as CRFs.   We demonstrate empirically that the hybrid loss typically performs as least as well as - and often better than - both of its constituent losses on variety of tasks. In doing so we also provide an empirical comparison of the efficacy of probabilistic and margin based approaches to multiclass and structured prediction and the effects of label dominance on these results.",Machine Learning
7747,Geometric Decision Tree,"In this paper we present a new algorithm for learning oblique decision trees. Most of the current decision tree algorithms rely on impurity measures to assess the goodness of hyperplanes at each node while learning a decision tree in a top-down fashion. These impurity measures do not properly capture the geometric structures in the data. Motivated by this, our algorithm uses a strategy to assess the hyperplanes in such a way that the geometric structure in the data is taken into account. At each node of the decision tree, we find the clustering hyperplanes for both the classes and use their angle bisectors as the split rule at that node. We show through empirical studies that this idea leads to small decision trees and better performance. We also present some analysis to show that the angle bisectors of clustering hyperplanes that we use as the split rules at each node, are solutions of an interesting optimization problem and hence argue that this is a principled method of learning a decision tree.",Machine Learning
7748,On the Doubt about Margin Explanation of Boosting,"Margin theory provides one of the most popular explanations to the success of \texttt{AdaBoost}, where the central point lies in the recognition that \textit{margin} is the key for characterizing the performance of \texttt{AdaBoost}. This theory has been very influential, e.g., it has been used to argue that \texttt{AdaBoost} usually does not overfit since it tends to enlarge the margin even after the training error reaches zero. Previously the \textit{minimum margin bound} was established for \texttt{AdaBoost}, however, \cite{Breiman1999} pointed out that maximizing the minimum margin does not necessarily lead to a better generalization. Later, \cite{Reyzin:Schapire2006} emphasized that the margin distribution rather than minimum margin is crucial to the performance of \texttt{AdaBoost}. In this paper, we first present the \textit{$k$th margin bound} and further study on its relationship to previous work such as the minimum margin bound and Emargin bound. Then, we improve the previous empirical Bernstein bounds \citep{Maurer:Pontil2009,Audibert:Munos:Szepesvari2009}, and based on such findings, we defend the margin-based explanation against Breiman's doubts by proving a new generalization error bound that considers exactly the same factors as \cite{Schapire:Freund:Bartlett:Lee1998} but is sharper than \cite{Breiman1999}'s minimum margin bound. By incorporating factors such as average margin and variance, we present a generalization error bound that is heavily related to the whole margin distribution. We also provide margin distribution bounds for generalization error of voting classifiers in finite VC-dimension space.",Machine Learning
7749,Totally Corrective Multiclass Boosting with Binary Weak Learners,"In this work, we propose a new optimization framework for multiclass boosting learning. In the literature, AdaBoost.MO and AdaBoost.ECC are the two successful multiclass boosting algorithms, which can use binary weak learners. We explicitly derive these two algorithms' Lagrange dual problems based on their regularized loss functions. We show that the Lagrange dual formulations enable us to design totally-corrective multiclass algorithms by using the primal-dual optimization technique. Experiments on benchmark data sets suggest that our multiclass boosting can achieve a comparable generalization capability with state-of-the-art, but the convergence speed is much faster than stage-wise gradient descent boosting. In other words, the new totally corrective algorithms can maximize the margin more aggressively.",Machine Learning

For typical hypothesis classes where R_n = \sqrt{R/n}, this translates to a learning rate of O(RH/n) in the separable (L*=0) case and O(RH/n + \sqrt{L^* RH/n}) more generally. We also provide similar guarantees for online and stochastic convex optimization with a smooth non-negative objective.",Machine Learning
7751,Efficient L1/Lq Norm Regularization,"Sparse learning has recently received increasing attention in many areas including machine learning, statistics, and applied mathematics. The mixed-norm regularization based on the L1/Lq norm with q > 1 is attractive in many applications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group sparsity in the model. The resulting optimization problem is, however, challenging to solve due to the structure of the L1/Lq -regularization. Existing work deals with special cases including q = 2,infinity, and they cannot be easily extended to the general case. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm based on the accelerated gradient method for solving the L1/Lq -regularized problem, which is applicable for all values of q larger than 1, thus significantly extending existing work. One key building block of the proposed algorithm is the L1/Lq -regularized Euclidean projection (EP1q). Our theoretical analysis reveals the key properties of EP1q and illustrates why EP1q for the general q is significantly more challenging to solve than the special cases. Based on our theoretical analysis, we develop an efficient algorithm for EP1q by solving two zero finding problems. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.",Machine Learning
7752,"Multi-parametric Solution-path Algorithm for Instance-weighted Support
  Vector Machines","An instance-weighted variant of the support vector machine (SVM) has attracted considerable attention recently since they are useful in various machine learning tasks such as non-stationary data analysis, heteroscedastic data modeling, transfer learning, learning to rank, and transduction. An important challenge in these scenarios is to overcome the computational bottleneck---instance weights often change dynamically or adaptively, and thus the weighted SVM solutions must be repeatedly computed. In this paper, we develop an algorithm that can efficiently and exactly update the weighted SVM solutions for arbitrary change of instance weights. Technically, this contribution can be regarded as an extension of the conventional solution-path algorithm for a single regularization parameter to multiple instance-weight parameters. However, this extension gives rise to a significant problem that breakpoints (at which the solution path turns) have to be identified in high-dimensional space. To facilitate this, we introduce a parametric representation of instance weights. We also provide a geometric interpretation in weight space using a notion of critical region: a polyhedron in which the current affine solution remains to be optimal. Then we find breakpoints at intersections of the solution path and boundaries of polyhedrons. Through extensive experiments on various practical applications, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed algorithm.",Machine Learning
7753,Portfolio Allocation for Bayesian Optimization,"Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes has become an increasingly popular tool in the machine learning community. It is efficient and can be used when very little is known about the objective function, making it popular in expensive black-box optimization scenarios. It uses Bayesian methods to sample the objective efficiently using an acquisition function which incorporates the model's estimate of the objective and the uncertainty at any given point. However, there are several different parameterized acquisition functions in the literature, and it is often unclear which one to use. Instead of using a single acquisition function, we adopt a portfolio of acquisition functions governed by an online multi-armed bandit strategy. We propose several portfolio strategies, the best of which we call GP-Hedge, and show that this method outperforms the best individual acquisition function. We also provide a theoretical bound on the algorithm's performance.",Machine Learning
7754,Fast Reinforcement Learning for Energy-Efficient Wireless Communications,"We consider the problem of energy-efficient point-to-point transmission of delay-sensitive data (e.g. multimedia data) over a fading channel. Existing research on this topic utilizes either physical-layer centric solutions, namely power-control and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC), or system-level solutions based on dynamic power management (DPM); however, there is currently no rigorous and unified framework for simultaneously utilizing both physical-layer centric and system-level techniques to achieve the minimum possible energy consumption, under delay constraints, in the presence of stochastic and a priori unknown traffic and channel conditions. In this report, we propose such a framework. We formulate the stochastic optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and solve it online using reinforcement learning. The advantages of the proposed online method are that (i) it does not require a priori knowledge of the traffic arrival and channel statistics to determine the jointly optimal power-control, AMC, and DPM policies; (ii) it exploits partial information about the system so that less information needs to be learned than when using conventional reinforcement learning algorithms; and (iii) it obviates the need for action exploration, which severely limits the adaptation speed and run-time performance of conventional reinforcement learning algorithms. Our results show that the proposed learning algorithms can converge up to two orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art learning algorithm for physical layer power-control and up to three orders of magnitude faster than conventional reinforcement learning algorithms.",Machine Learning
7755,The Attentive Perceptron,"We propose a focus of attention mechanism to speed up the Perceptron algorithm. Focus of attention speeds up the Perceptron algorithm by lowering the number of features evaluated throughout training and prediction. Whereas the traditional Perceptron evaluates all the features of each example, the Attentive Perceptron evaluates less features for easy to classify examples, thereby achieving significant speedups and small losses in prediction accuracy. Focus of attention allows the Attentive Perceptron to stop the evaluation of features at any interim point and filter the example. This creates an attentive filter which concentrates computation at examples that are hard to classify, and quickly filters examples that are easy to classify.",Machine Learning
7756,"Queue-Aware Distributive Resource Control for Delay-Sensitive Two-Hop
  MIMO Cooperative Systems","In this paper, we consider a queue-aware distributive resource control algorithm for two-hop MIMO cooperative systems. We shall illustrate that relay buffering is an effective way to reduce the intrinsic half-duplex penalty in cooperative systems. The complex interactions of the queues at the source node and the relays are modeled as an average-cost infinite horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP). The traditional approach solving this MDP problem involves centralized control with huge complexity. To obtain a distributive and low complexity solution, we introduce a linear structure which approximates the value function of the associated Bellman equation by the sum of per-node value functions. We derive a distributive two-stage two-winner auction-based control policy which is a function of the local CSI and local QSI only. Furthermore, to estimate the best fit approximation parameter, we propose a distributive online stochastic learning algorithm using stochastic approximation theory. Finally, we establish technical conditions for almost-sure convergence and show that under heavy traffic, the proposed low complexity distributive control is global optimal.",Machine Learning
7757,"Time Series Classification by Class-Specific Mahalanobis Distance
  Measures","To classify time series by nearest neighbors, we need to specify or learn one or several distance measures. We consider variations of the Mahalanobis distance measures which rely on the inverse covariance matrix of the data. Unfortunately --- for time series data --- the covariance matrix has often low rank. To alleviate this problem we can either use a pseudoinverse, covariance shrinking or limit the matrix to its diagonal. We review these alternatives and benchmark them against competitive methods such as the related Large Margin Nearest Neighbor Classification (LMNN) and the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. As we expected, we find that the DTW is superior, but the Mahalanobis distance measures are one to two orders of magnitude faster. To get best results with Mahalanobis distance measures, we recommend learning one distance measure per class using either covariance shrinking or the diagonal approach.",Machine Learning
7758,Algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization with the beta-divergence,"This paper describes algorithms for nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with the beta-divergence (beta-NMF). The beta-divergence is a family of cost functions parametrized by a single shape parameter beta that takes the Euclidean distance, the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Itakura-Saito divergence as special cases (beta = 2,1,0, respectively). The proposed algorithms are based on a surrogate auxiliary function (a local majorization of the criterion function). We first describe a majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm that leads to multiplicative updates, which differ from standard heuristic multiplicative updates by a beta-dependent power exponent. The monotonicity of the heuristic algorithm can however be proven for beta in (0,1) using the proposed auxiliary function. Then we introduce the concept of majorization-equalization (ME) algorithm which produces updates that move along constant level sets of the auxiliary function and lead to larger steps than MM. Simulations on synthetic and real data illustrate the faster convergence of the ME approach. The paper also describes how the proposed algorithms can be adapted to two common variants of NMF : penalized NMF (i.e., when a penalty function of the factors is added to the criterion function) and convex-NMF (when the dictionary is assumed to belong to a known subspace).",Machine Learning

  Threshold Functions","Hardness results for maximum agreement problems have close connections to hardness results for proper learning in computational learning theory. In this paper we prove two hardness results for the problem of finding a low degree polynomial threshold function (PTF) which has the maximum possible agreement with a given set of labeled examples in $\R^n \times \{-1,1\}.$ We prove that for any constants $d\geq 1, \eps > 0$,   {itemize}   Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, no polynomial-time algorithm can find a degree-$d$ PTF that is consistent with a $(\half + \eps)$ fraction of a given set of labeled examples in $\R^n \times \{-1,1\}$, even if there exists a degree-$d$ PTF that is consistent with a $1-\eps$ fraction of the examples.   It is $\NP$-hard to find a degree-2 PTF that is consistent with a $(\half + \eps)$ fraction of a given set of labeled examples in $\R^n \times \{-1,1\}$, even if there exists a halfspace (degree-1 PTF) that is consistent with a $1 - \eps$ fraction of the examples.   {itemize}   These results immediately imply the following hardness of learning results: (i) Assuming the Unique Games Conjecture, there is no better-than-trivial proper learning algorithm that agnostically learns degree-$d$ PTFs under arbitrary distributions; (ii) There is no better-than-trivial learning algorithm that outputs degree-2 PTFs and agnostically learns halfspaces (i.e. degree-1 PTFs) under arbitrary distributions.",Machine Learning

7761,Large-Scale Clustering Based on Data Compression,"This paper considers the clustering problem for large data sets. We propose an approach based on distributed optimization. The clustering problem is formulated as an optimization problem of maximizing the classification gain. We show that the optimization problem can be reformulated and decomposed into small-scale sub optimization problems by using the Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition method. Generally speaking, the Dantzig-Wolfe method can only be used for convex optimization problems, where the duality gaps are zero. Even though, the considered optimization problem in this paper is non-convex, we prove that the duality gap goes to zero, as the problem size goes to infinity. Therefore, the Dantzig-Wolfe method can be applied here. In the proposed approach, the clustering problem is iteratively solved by a group of computers coordinated by one center processor, where each computer solves one independent small-scale sub optimization problem during each iteration, and only a small amount of data communication is needed between the computers and center processor. Numerical results show that the proposed approach is effective and efficient.",Machine Learning

These new algorithms use a combination of a novel sampling techniques and a new multiplicative update algorithm. We give lower bounds which show the running times of many of our algorithms to be nearly best possible in the unit-cost RAM model. We also give implementations of our algorithms in the semi-streaming setting, obtaining the first low pass polylogarithmic space and sublinear time algorithms achieving arbitrary approximation factor.",Machine Learning

In this paper, we first extend AGM to strongly convex and composite objective functions with Bregman style prox-functions. Our unifying framework covers both the $\infty$-memory and 1-memory styles of AGM, tunes the Lipschiz constant adaptively, and bounds the duality gap. Then we demonstrate various ways to apply this framework of methods to a wide range of machine learning problems. Emphasis will be given on their rate of convergence and how to efficiently compute the gradient and optimize the models. The experimental results show that with our extensions AGM outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on max-margin models.",Machine Learning
7764,Online Importance Weight Aware Updates,"An importance weight quantifies the relative importance of one example over another, coming up in applications of boosting, asymmetric classification costs, reductions, and active learning. The standard approach for dealing with importance weights in gradient descent is via multiplication of the gradient. We first demonstrate the problems of this approach when importance weights are large, and argue in favor of more sophisticated ways for dealing with them. We then develop an approach which enjoys an invariance property: that updating twice with importance weight $h$ is equivalent to updating once with importance weight $2h$. For many important losses this has a closed form update which satisfies standard regret guarantees when all examples have $h=1$. We also briefly discuss two other reasonable approaches for handling large importance weights. Empirically, these approaches yield substantially superior prediction with similar computational performance while reducing the sensitivity of the algorithm to the exact setting of the learning rate. We apply these to online active learning yielding an extraordinarily fast active learning algorithm that works even in the presence of adversarial noise.",Machine Learning

In our estimation we interpret missing items as randomly censored observations and obtain efficient computation schemes using combinatorial properties of generating functions. We demonstrate our approach with several case studies involving real world movie recommendation data. The results are comparable with state-of-the-art techniques while also providing probabilistic preference estimates outside the scope of traditional recommender systems.",Machine Learning

Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian technique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with evidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of the next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into account both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and exploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best observation).

7768,"Queue-Aware Dynamic Clustering and Power Allocation for Network MIMO
  Systems via Distributive Stochastic Learning","In this paper, we propose a two-timescale delay-optimal dynamic clustering and power allocation design for downlink network MIMO systems. The dynamic clustering control is adaptive to the global queue state information (GQSI) only and computed at the base station controller (BSC) over a longer time scale. On the other hand, the power allocations of all the BSs in one cluster are adaptive to both intra-cluster channel state information (CCSI) and intra-cluster queue state information (CQSI), and computed at the cluster manager (CM) over a shorter time scale. We show that the two-timescale delay-optimal control can be formulated as an infinite-horizon average cost Constrained Partially Observed Markov Decision Process (CPOMDP). By exploiting the special problem structure, we shall derive an equivalent Bellman equation in terms of Pattern Selection Q-factor to solve the CPOMDP. To address the distributive requirement and the issue of exponential memory requirement and computational complexity, we approximate the Pattern Selection Q-factor by the sum of Per-cluster Potential functions and propose a novel distributive online learning algorithm to estimate the Per-cluster Potential functions (at each CM) as well as the Lagrange multipliers (LM) (at each BS). We show that the proposed distributive online learning algorithm converges almost surely (with probability 1). By exploiting the birth-death structure of the queue dynamics, we further decompose the Per-cluster Potential function into sum of Per-cluster Per-user Potential functions and formulate the instantaneous power allocation as a Per-stage QSI-aware Interference Game played among all the CMs. We also propose a QSI-aware Simultaneous Iterative Water-filling Algorithm (QSIWFA) and show that it can achieve the Nash Equilibrium (NE).",Machine Learning
7769,Survey & Experiment: Towards the Learning Accuracy,"To attain the best learning accuracy, people move on with difficulties and frustrations. Though one can optimize the empirical objective using a given set of samples, its generalization ability to the entire sample distribution remains questionable. Even if a fair generalization guarantee is offered, one still wants to know what is to happen if the regularizer is removed, and/or how well the artificial loss (like the hinge loss) relates to the accuracy.   For such reason, this report surveys four different trials towards the learning accuracy, embracing the major advances in supervised learning theory in the past four years. Starting from the generic setting of learning, the first two trials introduce the best optimization and generalization bounds for convex learning, and the third trial gets rid of the regularizer. As an innovative attempt, the fourth trial studies the optimization when the objective is exactly the accuracy, in the special case of binary classification. This report also analyzes the last trial through experiments.",Machine Learning

7771,"How I won the ""Chess Ratings - Elo vs the Rest of the World"" Competition","This article discusses in detail the rating system that won the kaggle competition ""Chess Ratings: Elo vs the rest of the world"". The competition provided a historical dataset of outcomes for chess games, and aimed to discover whether novel approaches can predict the outcomes of future games, more accurately than the well-known Elo rating system. The winning rating system, called Elo++ in the rest of the article, builds upon the Elo rating system. Like Elo, Elo++ uses a single rating per player and predicts the outcome of a game, by using a logistic curve over the difference in ratings of the players. The major component of Elo++ is a regularization technique that avoids overfitting these ratings. The dataset of chess games and outcomes is relatively small and one has to be careful not to draw ""too many conclusions"" out of the limited data. Many approaches tested in the competition showed signs of such an overfitting. The leader-board was dominated by attempts that did a very good job on a small test dataset, but couldn't generalize well on the private hold-out dataset. The Elo++ regularization takes into account the number of games per player, the recency of these games and the ratings of the opponents. Finally, Elo++ employs a stochastic gradient descent scheme for training the ratings, and uses only two global parameters (white's advantage and regularization constant) that are optimized using cross-validation.",Machine Learning
7772,The Role of Normalization in the Belief Propagation Algorithm,"An important part of problems in statistical physics and computer science can be expressed as the computation of marginal probabilities over a Markov Random Field. The belief propagation algorithm, which is an exact procedure to compute these marginals when the underlying graph is a tree, has gained its popularity as an efficient way to approximate them in the more general case. In this paper, we focus on an aspect of the algorithm that did not get that much attention in the literature, which is the effect of the normalization of the messages. We show in particular that, for a large class of normalization strategies, it is possible to focus only on belief convergence. Following this, we express the necessary and sufficient conditions for local stability of a fixed point in terms of the graph structure and the beliefs values at the fixed point. We also explicit some connexion between the normalization constants and the underlying Bethe Free Energy.",Machine Learning
7773,"Close the Gaps: A Learning-while-Doing Algorithm for a Class of
  Single-Product Revenue Management Problems","We consider a retailer selling a single product with limited on-hand inventory over a finite selling season. Customer demand arrives according to a Poisson process, the rate of which is influenced by a single action taken by the retailer (such as price adjustment, sales commission, advertisement intensity, etc.). The relationship between the action and the demand rate is not known in advance. However, the retailer is able to learn the optimal action ""on the fly"" as she maximizes her total expected revenue based on the observed demand reactions.   Using the pricing problem as an example, we propose a dynamic ""learning-while-doing"" algorithm that only involves function value estimation to achieve a near-optimal performance. Our algorithm employs a series of shrinking price intervals and iteratively tests prices within that interval using a set of carefully chosen parameters. We prove that the convergence rate of our algorithm is among the fastest of all possible algorithms in terms of asymptotic ""regret"" (the relative loss comparing to the full information optimal solution). Our result closes the performance gaps between parametric and non-parametric learning and between a post-price mechanism and a customer-bidding mechanism. Important managerial insight from this research is that the values of information on both the parametric form of the demand function as well as each customer's exact reservation price are less important than prior literature suggests. Our results also suggest that firms would be better off to perform dynamic learning and action concurrently rather than sequentially.",Machine Learning
7774,A Novel Template-Based Learning Model,"This article presents a model which is capable of learning and abstracting new concepts based on comparing observations and finding the resemblance between the observations. In the model, the new observations are compared with the templates which have been derived from the previous experiences. In the first stage, the objects are first represented through a geometric description which is used for finding the object boundaries and a descriptor which is inspired by the human visual system and then they are fed into the model. Next, the new observations are identified through comparing them with the previously-learned templates and are used for producing new templates. The comparisons are made based on measures like Euclidean or correlation distance. The new template is created by applying onion-pealing algorithm. The algorithm consecutively uses convex hulls which are made by the points representing the objects. If the new observation is remarkably similar to one of the observed categories, it is no longer utilized in creating a new template. The existing templates are used to provide a description of the new observation. This description is provided in the templates space. Each template represents a dimension of the feature space. The degree of the resemblance each template bears to each object indicates the value associated with the object in that dimension of the templates space. In this way, the description of the new observation becomes more accurate and detailed as the time passes and the experiences increase. We have used this model for learning and recognizing the new polygons in the polygon space. Representing the polygons was made possible through employing a geometric method and a method inspired by human visual system. Various implementations of the model have been compared. The evaluation results of the model prove its efficiency in learning and deriving new templates.",Machine Learning
7775,Learning transformed product distributions,"We consider the problem of learning an unknown product distribution $X$ over $\{0,1\}^n$ using samples $f(X)$ where $f$ is a \emph{known} transformation function. Each choice of a transformation function $f$ specifies a learning problem in this framework.   Information-theoretic arguments show that for every transformation function $f$ the corresponding learning problem can be solved to accuracy $\eps$, using $\tilde{O}(n/\eps^2)$ examples, by a generic algorithm whose running time may be exponential in $n.$ We show that this learning problem can be computationally intractable even for constant $\eps$ and rather simple transformation functions. Moreover, the above sample complexity bound is nearly optimal for the general problem, as we give a simple explicit linear transformation function $f(x)=w \cdot x$ with integer weights $w_i \leq n$ and prove that the corresponding learning problem requires $\Omega(n)$ samples.   As our main positive result we give a highly efficient algorithm for learning a sum of independent unknown Bernoulli random variables, corresponding to the transformation function $f(x)= \sum_{i=1}^n x_i$. Our algorithm learns to $\eps$-accuracy in poly$(n)$ time, using a surprising poly$(1/\eps)$ number of samples that is independent of $n.$ We also give an efficient algorithm that uses $\log n \cdot \poly(1/\eps)$ samples but has running time that is only $\poly(\log n, 1/\eps).$",Machine Learning
7776,A Feature Selection Method for Multivariate Performance Measures,"Feature selection with specific multivariate performance measures is the key to the success of many applications, such as image retrieval and text classification. The existing feature selection methods are usually designed for classification error. In this paper, we propose a generalized sparse regularizer. Based on the proposed regularizer, we present a unified feature selection framework for general loss functions. In particular, we study the novel feature selection paradigm by optimizing multivariate performance measures. The resultant formulation is a challenging problem for high-dimensional data. Hence, a two-layer cutting plane algorithm is proposed to solve this problem, and the convergence is presented. In addition, we adapt the proposed method to optimize multivariate measures for multiple instance learning problems. The analyses by comparing with the state-of-the-art feature selection methods show that the proposed method is superior to others. Extensive experiments on large-scale and high-dimensional real world datasets show that the proposed method outperforms $l_1$-SVM and SVM-RFE when choosing a small subset of features, and achieves significantly improved performances over SVM$^{perf}$ in terms of $F_1$-score.",Machine Learning

7778,Gaussian Robust Classification,"Supervised learning is all about the ability to generalize knowledge. Specifically, the goal of the learning is to train a classifier using training data, in such a way that it will be capable of classifying new unseen data correctly. In order to acheive this goal, it is important to carefully design the learner, so it will not overfit the training data. The later can is done usually by adding a regularization term. The statistical learning theory explains the success of this method by claiming that it restricts the complexity of the learned model. This explanation, however, is rather abstract and does not have a geometric intuition. The generalization error of a classifier may be thought of as correlated with its robustness to perturbations of the data: a classifier that copes with disturbance is expected to generalize well. Indeed, Xu et al. [2009] have shown that the SVM formulation is equivalent to a robust optimization (RO) formulation, in which an adversary displaces the training and testing points within a ball of pre-determined radius. In this work we explore a different kind of robustness, namely changing each data point with a Gaussian cloud centered at the sample. Loss is evaluated as the expectation of an underlying loss function on the cloud. This setup fits the fact that in many applications, the data is sampled along with noise. We develop an RO framework, in which the adversary chooses the covariance of the noise. In our algorithm named GURU, the tuning parameter is a spectral bound on the noise, thus it can be estimated using physical or applicative considerations. Our experiments show that this framework performs as well as SVM and even slightly better in some cases. Generalizations for Mercer kernels and for the multiclass case are presented as well. We also show that our framework may be further generalized, using the technique of convex perspective functions.",Machine Learning

  statistical learning","A fundamental result of statistical learnig theory states that a concept class is PAC learnable if and only if it is a uniform Glivenko-Cantelli class if and only if the VC dimension of the class is finite. However, the theorem is only valid under special assumptions of measurability of the class, in which case the PAC learnability even becomes consistent. Otherwise, there is a classical example, constructed under the Continuum Hypothesis by Dudley and Durst and further adapted by Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, and Warmuth, of a concept class of VC dimension one which is neither uniform Glivenko-Cantelli nor consistently PAC learnable. We show that, rather surprisingly, under an additional set-theoretic hypothesis which is much milder than the Continuum Hypothesis (Martin's Axiom), PAC learnability is equivalent to finite VC dimension for every concept class.",Machine Learning
7781,Temporal Second Difference Traces,"Q-learning is a reliable but inefficient off-policy temporal-difference method, backing up reward only one step at a time. Replacing traces, using a recency heuristic, are more efficient but less reliable. In this work, we introduce model-free, off-policy temporal difference methods that make better use of experience than Watkins' Q(\lambda). We introduce both Optimistic Q(\lambda) and the temporal second difference trace (TSDT). TSDT is particularly powerful in deterministic domains. TSDT uses neither recency nor frequency heuristics, storing (s,a,r,s',\delta) so that off-policy updates can be performed after apparently suboptimal actions have been taken. There are additional advantages when using state abstraction, as in MAXQ. We demonstrate that TSDT does significantly better than both Q-learning and Watkins' Q(\lambda) in a deterministic cliff-walking domain. Results in a noisy cliff-walking domain are less advantageous for TSDT, but demonstrate the efficacy of Optimistic Q(\lambda), a replacing trace with some of the advantages of TSDT.",Machine Learning
7782,"Reducing Commitment to Tasks with Off-Policy Hierarchical Reinforcement
  Learning","In experimenting with off-policy temporal difference (TD) methods in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) systems, we have observed unwanted on-policy learning under reproducible conditions. Here we present modifications to several TD methods that prevent unintentional on-policy learning from occurring. These modifications create a tension between exploration and learning. Traditional TD methods require commitment to finishing subtasks without exploration in order to update Q-values for early actions with high probability. One-step intra-option learning and temporal second difference traces (TSDT) do not suffer from this limitation. We demonstrate that our HRL system is efficient without commitment to completion of subtasks in a cliff-walking domain, contrary to a widespread claim in the literature that it is critical for efficiency of learning. Furthermore, decreasing commitment as exploration progresses is shown to improve both online performance and the resultant policy in the taxicab domain, opening a new avenue for research into when it is more beneficial to continue with the current subtask or to replan.",Machine Learning
7783,Attacking and Defending Covert Channels and Behavioral Models,"In this paper we present methods for attacking and defending $k$-gram statistical analysis techniques that are used, for example, in network traffic analysis and covert channel detection. The main new result is our demonstration of how to use a behavior's or process' $k$-order statistics to build a stochastic process that has those same $k$-order stationary statistics but possesses different, deliberately designed, $(k+1)$-order statistics if desired. Such a model realizes a ""complexification"" of the process or behavior which a defender can use to monitor whether an attacker is shaping the behavior. By deliberately introducing designed $(k+1)$-order behaviors, the defender can check to see if those behaviors are present in the data. We also develop constructs for source codes that respect the $k$-order statistics of a process while encoding covert information. One fundamental consequence of these results is that certain types of behavior analyses techniques come down to an {\em arms race} in the sense that the advantage goes to the party that has more computing resources applied to the problem.",Machine Learning
7784,Suboptimal Solution Path Algorithm for Support Vector Machine,"We consider a suboptimal solution path algorithm for the Support Vector Machine. The solution path algorithm is an effective tool for solving a sequence of a parametrized optimization problems in machine learning. The path of the solutions provided by this algorithm are very accurate and they satisfy the optimality conditions more strictly than other SVM optimization algorithms. In many machine learning application, however, this strict optimality is often unnecessary, and it adversely affects the computational efficiency. Our algorithm can generate the path of suboptimal solutions within an arbitrary user-specified tolerance level. It allows us to control the trade-off between the accuracy of the solution and the computational cost. Moreover, We also show that our suboptimal solutions can be interpreted as the solution of a \emph{perturbed optimization problem} from the original one. We provide some theoretical analyses of our algorithm based on this novel interpretation. The experimental results also demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm.",Machine Learning
7785,Domain Adaptation: Overfitting and Small Sample Statistics,"We study the prevalent problem when a test distribution differs from the training distribution. We consider a setting where our training set consists of a small number of sample domains, but where we have many samples in each domain. Our goal is to generalize to a new domain. For example, we may want to learn a similarity function using only certain classes of objects, but we desire that this similarity function be applicable to object classes not present in our training sample (e.g. we might seek to learn that ""dogs are similar to dogs"" even though images of dogs were absent from our training set). Our theoretical analysis shows that we can select many more features than domains while avoiding overfitting by utilizing data-dependent variance properties. We present a greedy feature selection algorithm based on using T-statistics. Our experiments validate this theory showing that our T-statistic based greedy feature selection is more robust at avoiding overfitting than the classical greedy procedure.",Machine Learning

Our strategy is based on Dawid's notion of calibration with more general changing checking rules and on some modification of Kakade and Foster's randomized algorithm for computing calibrated forecasts.",Machine Learning
7789,"Bounding the Fat Shattering Dimension of a Composition Function Class
  Built Using a Continuous Logic Connective","We begin this report by describing the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) model for learning a concept class, consisting of subsets of a domain, and a function class, consisting of functions from the domain to the unit interval. Two combinatorial parameters, the Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) dimension and its generalization, the Fat Shattering dimension of scale e, are explained and a few examples of their calculations are given with proofs. We then explain Sauer's Lemma, which involves the VC dimension and is used to prove the equivalence of a concept class being distribution-free PAC learnable and it having finite VC dimension.   As the main new result of our research, we explore the construction of a new function class, obtained by forming compositions with a continuous logic connective, a uniformly continuous function from the unit hypercube to the unit interval, from a collection of function classes. Vidyasagar had proved that such a composition function class has finite Fat Shattering dimension of all scales if the classes in the original collection do; however, no estimates of the dimension were known. Using results by Mendelson-Vershynin and Talagrand, we bound the Fat Shattering dimension of scale e of this new function class in terms of the Fat Shattering dimensions of the collection's classes.   We conclude this report by providing a few open questions and future research topics involving the PAC learning model.",Machine Learning
7790,"Online Learning, Stability, and Stochastic Gradient Descent","In batch learning, stability together with existence and uniqueness of the solution corresponds to well-posedness of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) methods; recently, it was proved that CV_loo stability is necessary and sufficient for generalization and consistency of ERM. In this note, we introduce CV_on stability, which plays a similar note in online learning. We show that stochastic gradient descent (SDG) with the usual hypotheses is CVon stable and we then discuss the implications of CV_on stability for convergence of SGD.",Machine Learning
7791,"Large-Scale Music Annotation and Retrieval: Learning to Rank in Joint
  Semantic Spaces","Music prediction tasks range from predicting tags given a song or clip of audio, predicting the name of the artist, or predicting related songs given a song, clip, artist name or tag. That is, we are interested in every semantic relationship between the different musical concepts in our database. In realistically sized databases, the number of songs is measured in the hundreds of thousands or more, and the number of artists in the tens of thousands or more, providing a considerable challenge to standard machine learning techniques. In this work, we propose a method that scales to such datasets which attempts to capture the semantic similarities between the database items by modeling audio, artist names, and tags in a single low-dimensional semantic space. This choice of space is learnt by optimizing the set of prediction tasks of interest jointly using multi-task learning. Our method both outperforms baseline methods and, in comparison to them, is faster and consumes less memory. We then demonstrate how our method learns an interpretable model, where the semantic space captures well the similarities of interest.",Machine Learning
7792,Kernel Belief Propagation,"We propose a nonparametric generalization of belief propagation, Kernel Belief Propagation (KBP), for pairwise Markov random fields. Messages are represented as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and message updates are simple linear operations in the RKHS. KBP makes none of the assumptions commonly required in classical BP algorithms: the variables need not arise from a finite domain or a Gaussian distribution, nor must their relations take any particular parametric form. Rather, the relations between variables are represented implicitly, and are learned nonparametrically from training data. KBP has the advantage that it may be used on any domain where kernels are defined (Rd, strings, groups), even where explicit parametric models are not known, or closed form expressions for the BP updates do not exist. The computational cost of message updates in KBP is polynomial in the training data size. We also propose a constant time approximate message update procedure by representing messages using a small number of basis functions. In experiments, we apply KBP to image denoising, depth prediction from still images, and protein configuration prediction: KBP is faster than competing classical and nonparametric approaches (by orders of magnitude, in some cases), while providing significantly more accurate results.",Machine Learning
7793,The Perceptron with Dynamic Margin,"The classical perceptron rule provides a varying upper bound on the maximum margin, namely the length of the current weight vector divided by the total number of updates up to that time. Requiring that the perceptron updates its internal state whenever the normalized margin of a pattern is found not to exceed a certain fraction of this dynamic upper bound we construct a new approximate maximum margin classifier called the perceptron with dynamic margin (PDM). We demonstrate that PDM converges in a finite number of steps and derive an upper bound on them. We also compare experimentally PDM with other perceptron-like algorithms and support vector machines on hard margin tasks involving linear kernels which are equivalent to 2-norm soft margin.",Machine Learning
7794,A Unified Framework for Approximating and Clustering Data,"Given a set $F$ of $n$ positive functions over a ground set $X$, we consider the problem of computing $x^*$ that minimizes the expression $\sum_{f\in F}f(x)$, over $x\in X$. A typical application is \emph{shape fitting}, where we wish to approximate a set $P$ of $n$ elements (say, points) by a shape $x$ from a (possibly infinite) family $X$ of shapes. Here, each point $p\in P$ corresponds to a function $f$ such that $f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to $x$, and we seek a shape $x$ that minimizes the sum of distances from each point in $P$. In the $k$-clustering variant, each $x\in X$ is a tuple of $k$ shapes, and $f(x)$ is the distance from $p$ to its closest shape in $x$.   Our main result is a unified framework for constructing {\em coresets} and {\em approximate clustering} for such general sets of functions. To achieve our results, we forge a link between the classic and well defined notion of $\varepsilon$-approximations from the theory of PAC Learning and VC dimension, to the relatively new (and not so consistent) paradigm of coresets, which are some kind of ""compressed representation"" of the input set $F$. Using traditional techniques, a coreset usually implies an LTAS (linear time approximation scheme) for the corresponding optimization problem, which can be computed in parallel, via one pass over the data, and using only polylogarithmic space (i.e, in the streaming model).   We show how to generalize the results of our framework for squared distances (as in $k$-mean), distances to the $q$th power, and deterministic constructions.",Machine Learning
7795,"Max-Margin Stacking and Sparse Regularization for Linear Classifier
  Combination and Selection","The main principle of stacked generalization (or Stacking) is using a second-level generalizer to combine the outputs of base classifiers in an ensemble. In this paper, we investigate different combination types under the stacking framework; namely weighted sum (WS), class-dependent weighted sum (CWS) and linear stacked generalization (LSG). For learning the weights, we propose using regularized empirical risk minimization with the hinge loss. In addition, we propose using group sparsity for regularization to facilitate classifier selection. We performed experiments using two different ensemble setups with differing diversities on 8 real-world datasets. Results show the power of regularized learning with the hinge loss function. Using sparse regularization, we are able to reduce the number of selected classifiers of the diverse ensemble without sacrificing accuracy. With the non-diverse ensembles, we even gain accuracy on average by using sparse regularization.",Machine Learning
7796,"Reinforcement learning based sensing policy optimization for energy
  efficient cognitive radio networks","This paper introduces a machine learning based collaborative multi-band spectrum sensing policy for cognitive radios. The proposed sensing policy guides secondary users to focus the search of unused radio spectrum to those frequencies that persistently provide them high data rate. The proposed policy is based on machine learning, which makes it adaptive with the temporally and spatially varying radio spectrum. Furthermore, there is no need for dynamic modeling of the primary activity since it is implicitly learned over time. Energy efficiency is achieved by minimizing the number of assigned sensors per each subband under a constraint on miss detection probability. It is important to control the missed detections because they cause collisions with primary transmissions and lead to retransmissions at both the primary and secondary user. Simulations show that the proposed machine learning based sensing policy improves the overall throughput of the secondary network and improves the energy efficiency while controlling the miss detection probability.",Machine Learning
7797,Learning the Dependence Graph of Time Series with Latent Factors,"This paper considers the problem of learning, from samples, the dependency structure of a system of linear stochastic differential equations, when some of the variables are latent. In particular, we observe the time evolution of some variables, and never observe other variables; from this, we would like to find the dependency structure between the observed variables - separating out the spurious interactions caused by the (marginalizing out of the) latent variables' time series. We develop a new method, based on convex optimization, to do so in the case when the number of latent variables is smaller than the number of observed ones. For the case when the dependency structure between the observed variables is sparse, we theoretically establish a high-dimensional scaling result for structure recovery. We verify our theoretical result with both synthetic and real data (from the stock market).",Machine Learning
7798,On epsilon-optimality of the pursuit learning algorithm,"Estimator algorithms in learning automata are useful tools for adaptive, real-time optimization in computer science and engineering applications. This paper investigates theoretical convergence properties for a special case of estimator algorithms: the pursuit learning algorithm. In this note, we identify and fill a gap in existing proofs of probabilistic convergence for pursuit learning. It is tradition to take the pursuit learning tuning parameter to be fixed in practical applications, but our proof sheds light on the importance of a vanishing sequence of tuning parameters in a theoretical convergence analysis.",Machine Learning
7799,"Decoding finger movements from ECoG signals using switching linear
  models",One of the major challenges of ECoG-based Brain-Machine Interfaces is the movement prediction of a human subject. Several methods exist to predict an arm 2-D trajectory. The fourth BCI Competition gives a dataset in which the aim is to predict individual finger movements (5-D trajectory). The difficulty lies in the fact that there is no simple relation between ECoG signals and finger movement. We propose in this paper to decode finger flexions using switching models. This method permits to simplify the system as it is now described as an ensemble of linear models depending on an internal state. We show that an interesting accuracy prediction can be obtained by such a model.,Machine Learning
7800,Large margin filtering for signal sequence labeling,Signal Sequence Labeling consists in predicting a sequence of labels given an observed sequence of samples. A naive way is to filter the signal in order to reduce the noise and to apply a classification algorithm on the filtered samples. We propose in this paper to jointly learn the filter with the classifier leading to a large margin filtering for classification. This method allows to learn the optimal cutoff frequency and phase of the filter that may be different from zero. Two methods are proposed and tested on a toy dataset and on a real life BCI dataset from BCI Competition III.,Machine Learning
7801,Handling uncertainties in SVM classification,This paper addresses the pattern classification problem arising when available target data include some uncertainty information. Target data considered here is either qualitative (a class label) or quantitative (an estimation of the posterior probability). Our main contribution is a SVM inspired formulation of this problem allowing to take into account class label through a hinge loss as well as probability estimates using epsilon-insensitive cost function together with a minimum norm (maximum margin) objective. This formulation shows a dual form leading to a quadratic problem and allows the use of a representer theorem and associated kernel. The solution provided can be used for both decision and posterior probability estimation. Based on empirical evidence our method outperforms regular SVM in terms of probability predictions and classification performances.,Machine Learning

In testing, our implementation greatly outperforms that of an existing tool that relies on a Bayesian classifier. Code is written in Python and available under an MIT license.",Machine Learning
7803,Better Mini-Batch Algorithms via Accelerated Gradient Methods,"Mini-batch algorithms have been proposed as a way to speed-up stochastic convex optimization problems. We study how such algorithms can be improved using accelerated gradient methods.

7804,Potential-Based Shaping and Q-Value Initialization are Equivalent,"Shaping has proven to be a powerful but precarious means of improving reinforcement learning performance. Ng, Harada, and Russell (1999) proposed the potential-based shaping algorithm for adding shaping rewards in a way that guarantees the learner will learn optimal behavior. In this note, we prove certain similarities between this shaping algorithm and the initialization step required for several reinforcement learning algorithms. More specifically, we prove that a reinforcement learner with initial Q-values based on the shaping algorithm's potential function make the same updates throughout learning as a learner receiving potential-based shaping rewards. We further prove that under a broad category of policies, the behavior of these two learners are indistinguishable. The comparison provides intuition on the theoretical properties of the shaping algorithm as well as a suggestion for a simpler method for capturing the algorithm's benefit. In addition, the equivalence raises previously unaddressed issues concerning the efficiency of learning with potential-based shaping.",Machine Learning
7805,"IBSEAD: - A Self-Evolving Self-Obsessed Learning Algorithm for Machine
  Learning","We present IBSEAD or distributed autonomous entity systems based Interaction - a learning algorithm for the computer to self-evolve in a self-obsessed manner. This learning algorithm will present the computer to look at the internal and external environment in series of independent entities, which will interact with each other, with and/or without knowledge of the computer's brain. When a learning algorithm interacts, it does so by detecting and understanding the entities in the human algorithm. However, the problem with this approach is that the algorithm does not consider the interaction of the third party or unknown entities, which may be interacting with each other. These unknown entities in their interaction with the non-computer entities make an effect in the environment that influences the information and the behaviour of the computer brain. Such details and the ability to process the dynamic and unsettling nature of these interactions are absent in the current learning algorithm such as the decision tree learning algorithm. IBSEAD is able to evaluate and consider such algorithms and thus give us a better accuracy in simulation of the highly evolved nature of the human brain. Processes such as dreams, imagination and novelty, that exist in humans are not fully simulated by the existing learning algorithms. Also, Hidden Markov models (HMM) are useful in finding ""hidden"" entities, which may be known or unknown. However, this model fails to consider the case of unknown entities which maybe unclear or unknown. IBSEAD is better because it considers three types of entities- known, unknown and invisible. We present our case with a comparison of existing algorithms in known environments and cases and present the results of the experiments using dry run of the simulated runs of the existing machine learning algorithms versus IBSEAD.",Machine Learning
7806,A Note on Improved Loss Bounds for Multiple Kernel Learning,"In this paper, we correct an upper bound, presented in~\cite{hs-11}, on the generalisation error of classifiers learned through multiple kernel learning. The bound in~\cite{hs-11} uses Rademacher complexity and has an\emph{additive} dependence on the logarithm of the number of kernels and the margin achieved by the classifier. However, there are some errors in parts of the proof which are corrected in this paper. Unfortunately, the final result turns out to be a risk bound which has a \emph{multiplicative} dependence on the logarithm of the number of kernels and the margin achieved by the classifier.",Machine Learning
7807,GraphLab: A Distributed Framework for Machine Learning in the Cloud,"Machine Learning (ML) techniques are indispensable in a wide range of fields. Unfortunately, the exponential increase of dataset sizes are rapidly extending the runtime of sequential algorithms and threatening to slow future progress in ML. With the promise of affordable large-scale parallel computing, Cloud systems offer a viable platform to resolve the computational challenges in ML. However, designing and implementing efficient, provably correct distributed ML algorithms is often prohibitively challenging. To enable ML researchers to easily and efficiently use parallel systems, we introduced the GraphLab abstraction which is designed to represent the computational patterns in ML algorithms while permitting efficient parallel and distributed implementations. In this paper we provide a formal description of the GraphLab parallel abstraction and present an efficient distributed implementation. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of GraphLab on three state-of-the-art ML algorithms using real large-scale data and a 64 node EC2 cluster of 512 processors. We find that GraphLab achieves orders of magnitude performance gains over Hadoop while performing comparably or superior to hand-tuned MPI implementations.",Machine Learning
7808,"Towards Optimal One Pass Large Scale Learning with Averaged Stochastic
  Gradient Descent","For large scale learning problems, it is desirable if we can obtain the optimal model parameters by going through the data in only one pass. Polyak and Juditsky (1992) showed that asymptotically the test performance of the simple average of the parameters obtained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is as good as that of the parameters which minimize the empirical cost. However, to our knowledge, despite its optimal asymptotic convergence rate, averaged SGD (ASGD) received little attention in recent research on large scale learning. One possible reason is that it may take a prohibitively large number of training samples for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region for most real problems. In this paper, we present a finite sample analysis for the method of Polyak and Juditsky (1992). Our analysis shows that it indeed usually takes a huge number of samples for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region for improperly chosen learning rate. More importantly, based on our analysis, we propose a simple way to properly set learning rate so that it takes a reasonable amount of data for ASGD to reach its asymptotic region. We compare ASGD using our proposed learning rate with other well known algorithms for training large scale linear classifiers. The experiments clearly show the superiority of ASGD.",Machine Learning
7809,Discovering Knowledge using a Constraint-based Language,"Discovering pattern sets or global patterns is an attractive issue from the pattern mining community in order to provide useful information. By combining local patterns satisfying a joint meaning, this approach produces patterns of higher level and thus more useful for the data analyst than the usual local patterns, while reducing the number of patterns. In parallel, recent works investigating relationships between data mining and constraint programming (CP) show that the CP paradigm is a nice framework to model and mine such patterns in a declarative and generic way. We present a constraint-based language which enables us to define queries addressing patterns sets and global patterns. The usefulness of such a declarative approach is highlighted by several examples coming from the clustering based on associations. This language has been implemented in the CP framework.",Machine Learning

These divergence examples differ from previous divergence examples in the literature, in that they are applicable for a greedy policy, i.e. in a ""value iteration"" scenario. Perhaps surprisingly, with a greedy policy, it is also possible to get divergence for the algorithms TD(1) and Sarsa(1). In addition to these divergences, we also achieve divergence for the Adaptive Dynamic Programming algorithms HDP, DHP and GDHP.",Machine Learning
7812,Axioms for Rational Reinforcement Learning,"We provide a formal, simple and intuitive theory of rational decision making including sequential decisions that affect the environment. The theory has a geometric flavor, which makes the arguments easy to visualize and understand. Our theory is for complete decision makers, which means that they have a complete set of preferences. Our main result shows that a complete rational decision maker implicitly has a probabilistic model of the environment. We have a countable version of this result that brings light on the issue of countable vs finite additivity by showing how it depends on the geometry of the space which we have preferences over. This is achieved through fruitfully connecting rationality with the Hahn-Banach Theorem. The theory presented here can be viewed as a formalization and extension of the betting odds approach to probability of Ramsey and De Finetti.",Machine Learning
7813,Automatic Network Reconstruction using ASP,"Building biological models by inferring functional dependencies from experimental data is an im- portant issue in Molecular Biology. To relieve the biologist from this traditionally manual process, various approaches have been proposed to increase the degree of automation. However, available ap- proaches often yield a single model only, rely on specific assumptions, and/or use dedicated, heuris- tic algorithms that are intolerant to changing circumstances or requirements in the view of the rapid progress made in Biotechnology. Our aim is to provide a declarative solution to the problem by ap- peal to Answer Set Programming (ASP) overcoming these difficulties. We build upon an existing approach to Automatic Network Reconstruction proposed by part of the authors. This approach has firm mathematical foundations and is well suited for ASP due to its combinatorial flavor providing a characterization of all models explaining a set of experiments. The usage of ASP has several ben- efits over the existing heuristic algorithms. First, it is declarative and thus transparent for biological experts. Second, it is elaboration tolerant and thus allows for an easy exploration and incorporation of biological constraints. Third, it allows for exploring the entire space of possible models. Finally, our approach offers an excellent performance, matching existing, special-purpose systems.",Machine Learning

  Analysis","Detecting changes in high-dimensional time series is difficult because it involves the comparison of probability densities that need to be estimated from finite samples. In this paper, we present the first feature extraction method tailored to change point detection, which is based on an extended version of Stationary Subspace Analysis. We reduce the dimensionality of the data to the most non-stationary directions, which are most informative for detecting state changes in the time series. In extensive simulations on synthetic data we show that the accuracy of three change point detection algorithms is significantly increased by a prior feature extraction step. These findings are confirmed in an application to industrial fault monitoring.",Machine Learning

  Observed Attributes","We consider the most common variants of linear regression, including Ridge, Lasso and Support-vector regression, in a setting where the learner is allowed to observe only a fixed number of attributes of each example at training time. We present simple and efficient algorithms for these problems: for Lasso and Ridge regression they need the same total number of attributes (up to constants) as do full-information algorithms, for reaching a certain accuracy. For Support-vector regression, we require exponentially less attributes compared to the state of the art. By that, we resolve an open problem recently posed by Cesa-Bianchi et al. (2010). Experiments show the theoretical bounds to be justified by superior performance compared to the state of the art.",Machine Learning
7816,Non-trivial two-armed partial-monitoring games are bandits,We consider online learning in partial-monitoring games against an oblivious adversary. We show that when the number of actions available to the learner is two and the game is nontrivial then it is reducible to a bandit-like game and thus the minimax regret is $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$.,Machine Learning
7817,Local Component Analysis,"Kernel density estimation, a.k.a. Parzen windows, is a popular density estimation method, which can be used for outlier detection or clustering. With multivariate data, its performance is heavily reliant on the metric used within the kernel. Most earlier work has focused on learning only the bandwidth of the kernel (i.e., a scalar multiplicative factor). In this paper, we propose to learn a full Euclidean metric through an expectation-minimization (EM) procedure, which can be seen as an unsupervised counterpart to neighbourhood component analysis (NCA). In order to avoid overfitting with a fully nonparametric density estimator in high dimensions, we also consider a semi-parametric Gaussian-Parzen density model, where some of the variables are modelled through a jointly Gaussian density, while others are modelled through Parzen windows. For these two models, EM leads to simple closed-form updates based on matrix inversions and eigenvalue decompositions. We show empirically that our method leads to density estimators with higher test-likelihoods than natural competing methods, and that the metrics may be used within most unsupervised learning techniques that rely on such metrics, such as spectral clustering or manifold learning methods. Finally, we present a stochastic approximation scheme which allows for the use of this method in a large-scale setting.",Machine Learning
7818,Weighted Clustering,"One of the most prominent challenges in clustering is ""the user's dilemma,"" which is the problem of selecting an appropriate clustering algorithm for a specific task. A formal approach for addressing this problem relies on the identification of succinct, user-friendly properties that formally capture when certain clustering methods are preferred over others.   Until now these properties focused on advantages of classical Linkage-Based algorithms, failing to identify when other clustering paradigms, such as popular center-based methods, are preferable. We present surprisingly simple new properties that delineate the differences between common clustering paradigms, which clearly and formally demonstrates advantages of center-based approaches for some applications. These properties address how sensitive algorithms are to changes in element frequencies, which we capture in a generalized setting where every element is associated with a real-valued weight.",Machine Learning
7819,"Learning From Labeled And Unlabeled Data: An Empirical Study Across
  Techniques And Domains","There has been increased interest in devising learning techniques that combine unlabeled data with labeled data ? i.e. semi-supervised learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has been performed across various techniques and different types and amounts of labeled and unlabeled data. Moreover, most of the published work on semi-supervised learning techniques assumes that the labeled and unlabeled data come from the same distribution. It is possible for the labeling process to be associated with a selection bias such that the distributions of data points in the labeled and unlabeled sets are different. Not correcting for such bias can result in biased function approximation with potentially poor performance. In this paper, we present an empirical study of various semi-supervised learning techniques on a variety of datasets. We attempt to answer various questions such as the effect of independence or relevance amongst features, the effect of the size of the labeled and unlabeled sets and the effect of noise. We also investigate the impact of sample-selection bias on the semi-supervised learning techniques under study and implement a bivariate probit technique particularly designed to correct for such bias.",Machine Learning
7820,"Efficiency versus Convergence of Boolean Kernels for On-Line Learning
  Algorithms","The paper studies machine learning problems where each example is described using a set of Boolean features and where hypotheses are represented by linear threshold elements. One method of increasing the expressiveness of learned hypotheses in this context is to expand the feature set to include conjunctions of basic features. This can be done explicitly or where possible by using a kernel function. Focusing on the well known Perceptron and Winnow algorithms, the paper demonstrates a tradeoff between the computational efficiency with which the algorithm can be run over the expanded feature space and the generalization ability of the corresponding learning algorithm. We first describe several kernel functions which capture either limited forms of conjunctions or all conjunctions. We show that these kernels can be used to efficiently run the Perceptron algorithm over a feature space of exponentially many conjunctions; however we also show that using such kernels, the Perceptron algorithm can provably make an exponential number of mistakes even when learning simple functions. We then consider the question of whether kernel functions can analogously be used to run the multiplicative-update Winnow algorithm over an expanded feature space of exponentially many conjunctions. Known upper bounds imply that the Winnow algorithm can learn Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) formulae with a polynomial mistake bound in this setting. However, we prove that it is computationally hard to simulate Winnows behavior for learning DNF over such a feature set. This implies that the kernel functions which correspond to running Winnow for this problem are not efficiently computable, and that there is no general construction that can run Winnow with kernels.",Machine Learning
7821,"Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning Applied to Control under
  Constraints","In this paper, we consider Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with error states. Error states are those states entering which is undesirable or dangerous. We define the risk with respect to a policy as the probability of entering such a state when the policy is pursued. We consider the problem of finding good policies whose risk is smaller than some user-specified threshold, and formalize it as a constrained MDP with two criteria. The first criterion corresponds to the value function originally given. We will show that the risk can be formulated as a second criterion function based on a cumulative return, whose definition is independent of the original value function. We present a model free, heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm that aims at finding good deterministic policies. It is based on weighting the original value function and the risk. The weight parameter is adapted in order to find a feasible solution for the constrained problem that has a good performance with respect to the value function. The algorithm was successfully applied to the control of a feed tank with stochastic inflows that lies upstream of a distillation column. This control task was originally formulated as an optimal control problem with chance constraints, and it was solved under certain assumptions on the model to obtain an optimal solution. The power of our learning algorithm is that it can be used even when some of these restrictive assumptions are relaxed.",Machine Learning
7822,Bandits with an Edge,"We consider a bandit problem over a graph where the rewards are not directly observed. Instead, the decision maker can compare two nodes and receive (stochastic) information pertaining to the difference in their value. The graph structure describes the set of possible comparisons. Consequently, comparing between two nodes that are relatively far requires estimating the difference between every pair of nodes on the path between them. We analyze this problem from the perspective of sample complexity: How many queries are needed to find an approximately optimal node with probability more than $1-\delta$ in the PAC setup? We show that the topology of the graph plays a crucial in defining the sample complexity: graphs with a low diameter have a much better sample complexity.",Machine Learning
7823,Distributed User Profiling via Spectral Methods,"User profiling is a useful primitive for constructing personalised services, such as content recommendation. In the present paper we investigate the feasibility of user profiling in a distributed setting, with no central authority and only local information exchanges between users. We compute a profile vector for each user (i.e., a low-dimensional vector that characterises her taste) via spectral transformation of observed user-produced ratings for items. Our two main contributions follow: i) We consider a low-rank probabilistic model of user taste. More specifically, we consider that users and items are partitioned in a constant number of classes, such that users and items within the same class are statistically identical. We prove that without prior knowledge of the compositions of the classes, based solely on few random observed ratings (namely $O(N\log N)$ such ratings for $N$ users), we can predict user preference with high probability for unrated items by running a local vote among users with similar profile vectors. In addition, we provide empirical evaluations characterising the way in which spectral profiling performance depends on the dimension of the profile space. Such evaluations are performed on a data set of real user ratings provided by Netflix. ii) We develop distributed algorithms which provably achieve an embedding of users into a low-dimensional space, based on spectral transformation. These involve simple message passing among users, and provably converge to the desired embedding. Our method essentially relies on a novel combination of gossiping and the algorithm proposed by Oja and Karhunen.",Machine Learning
7824,Learning Topic Models by Belief Propagation,"Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is an important hierarchical Bayesian model for probabilistic topic modeling, which attracts worldwide interests and touches on many important applications in text mining, computer vision and computational biology. This paper represents LDA as a factor graph within the Markov random field (MRF) framework, which enables the classic loopy belief propagation (BP) algorithm for approximate inference and parameter estimation. Although two commonly-used approximate inference methods, such as variational Bayes (VB) and collapsed Gibbs sampling (GS), have gained great successes in learning LDA, the proposed BP is competitive in both speed and accuracy as validated by encouraging experimental results on four large-scale document data sets. Furthermore, the BP algorithm has the potential to become a generic learning scheme for variants of LDA-based topic models. To this end, we show how to learn two typical variants of LDA-based topic models, such as author-topic models (ATM) and relational topic models (RTM), using BP based on the factor graph representation.",Machine Learning
7825,Application of distances between terms for flat and hierarchical data,"In machine learning, distance-based algorithms, and other approaches, use information that is represented by propositional data. However, this kind of representation can be quite restrictive and, in many cases, it requires more complex structures in order to represent data in a more natural way. Terms are the basis for functional and logic programming representation. Distances between terms are a useful tool not only to compare terms, but also to determine the search space in many of these applications. This dissertation applies distances between terms, exploiting the features of each distance and the possibility to compare from propositional data types to hierarchical representations. The distances between terms are applied through the k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) classification algorithm using XML as a common language representation. To be able to represent these data in an XML structure and to take advantage of the benefits of distance between terms, it is necessary to apply some transformations. These transformations allow the conversion of flat data into hierarchical data represented in XML, using some techniques based on intuitive associations between the names and values of variables and associations based on attribute similarity.   Several experiments with the distances between terms of Nienhuys-Cheng and Estruch et al. were performed. In the case of originally propositional data, these distances are compared to the Euclidean distance. In all cases, the experiments were performed with the distance-weighted k-nearest neighbor algorithm, using several exponents for the attraction function (weighted distance). It can be seen that in some cases, the term distances can significantly improve the results on approaches applied to flat representations.",Machine Learning
7826,Noise Tolerance under Risk Minimization,"In this paper we explore noise tolerant learning of classifiers. We formulate the problem as follows. We assume that there is an ${\bf unobservable}$ training set which is noise-free. The actual training set given to the learning algorithm is obtained from this ideal data set by corrupting the class label of each example. The probability that the class label of an example is corrupted is a function of the feature vector of the example. This would account for most kinds of noisy data one encounters in practice. We say that a learning method is noise tolerant if the classifiers learnt with the ideal noise-free data and with noisy data, both have the same classification accuracy on the noise-free data. In this paper we analyze the noise tolerance properties of risk minimization (under different loss functions), which is a generic method for learning classifiers. We show that risk minimization under 0-1 loss function has impressive noise tolerance properties and that under squared error loss is tolerant only to uniform noise; risk minimization under other loss functions is not noise tolerant. We conclude the paper with some discussion on implications of these theoretical results.",Machine Learning
7827,Active Learning with Multiple Views,"Active learners alleviate the burden of labeling large amounts of data by detecting and asking the user to label only the most informative examples in the domain. We focus here on active learning for multi-view domains, in which there are several disjoint subsets of features (views), each of which is sufficient to learn the target concept. In this paper we make several contributions. First, we introduce Co-Testing, which is the first approach to multi-view active learning. Second, we extend the multi-view learning framework by also exploiting weak views, which are adequate only for learning a concept that is more general/specific than the target concept. Finally, we empirically show that Co-Testing outperforms existing active learners on a variety of real world domains such as wrapper induction, Web page classification, advertisement removal, and discourse tree parsing.",Machine Learning
7828,The Augmented Complex Kernel LMS,"Recently, a unified framework for adaptive kernel based signal processing of complex data was presented by the authors, which, besides offering techniques to map the input data to complex Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces, developed a suitable Wirtinger-like Calculus for general Hilbert Spaces. In this short paper, the extended Wirtinger's calculus is adopted to derive complex kernel-based widely-linear estimation filters. Furthermore, we illuminate several important characteristics of the widely linear filters. We show that, although in many cases the gains from adopting widely linear estimation filters, as alternatives to ordinary linear ones, are rudimentary, for the case of kernel based widely linear filters significant performance improvements can be obtained.",Machine Learning
7829,Dynamic Matrix Factorization: A State Space Approach,"Matrix factorization from a small number of observed entries has recently garnered much attention as the key ingredient of successful recommendation systems. One unresolved problem in this area is how to adapt current methods to handle changing user preferences over time. Recent proposals to address this issue are heuristic in nature and do not fully exploit the time-dependent structure of the problem. As a principled and general temporal formulation, we propose a dynamical state space model of matrix factorization. Our proposal builds upon probabilistic matrix factorization, a Bayesian model with Gaussian priors. We utilize results in state tracking, such as the Kalman filter, to provide accurate recommendations in the presence of both process and measurement noise. We show how system parameters can be learned via expectation-maximization and provide comparisons to current published techniques.",Machine Learning
7830,"Active Learning Using Smooth Relative Regret Approximations with
  Applications","The disagreement coefficient of Hanneke has become a central data independent invariant in proving active learning rates. It has been shown in various ways that a concept class with low complexity together with a bound on the disagreement coefficient at an optimal solution allows active learning rates that are superior to passive learning ones.   We present a different tool for pool based active learning which follows from the existence of a certain uniform version of low disagreement coefficient, but is not equivalent to it. In fact, we present two fundamental active learning problems of significant interest for which our approach allows nontrivial active learning bounds. However, any general purpose method relying on the disagreement coefficient bounds only fails to guarantee any useful bounds for these problems.   The tool we use is based on the learner's ability to compute an estimator of the difference between the loss of any hypotheses and some fixed ""pivotal"" hypothesis to within an absolute error of at most $\eps$ times the",Machine Learning
7831,"Supervised learning of short and high-dimensional temporal sequences for
  life science measurements","The analysis of physiological processes over time are often given by spectrometric or gene expression profiles over time with only few time points but a large number of measured variables. The analysis of such temporal sequences is challenging and only few methods have been proposed. The information can be encoded time independent, by means of classical expression differences for a single time point or in expression profiles over time. Available methods are limited to unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. The predictive variables can be identified only by means of wrapper or post-processing techniques. This is complicated due to the small number of samples for such studies. Here, we present a supervised learning approach, termed Supervised Topographic Mapping Through Time (SGTM-TT). It learns a supervised mapping of the temporal sequences onto a low dimensional grid. We utilize a hidden markov model (HMM) to account for the time domain and relevance learning to identify the relevant feature dimensions most predictive over time. The learned mapping can be used to visualize the temporal sequences and to predict the class of a new sequence. The relevance learning permits the identification of discriminating masses or gen expressions and prunes dimensions which are unnecessary for the classification task or encode mainly noise. In this way we obtain a very efficient learning system for temporal sequences. The results indicate that using simultaneous supervised learning and metric adaptation significantly improves the prediction accuracy for synthetically and real life data in comparison to the standard techniques. The discriminating features, identified by relevance learning, compare favorably with the results of alternative methods. Our method permits the visualization of the data on a low dimensional grid, highlighting the observed temporal structure.",Machine Learning
7832,Dynamic Batch Bayesian Optimization,"Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithms try to optimize an unknown function that is expensive to evaluate using minimum number of evaluations/experiments. Most of the proposed algorithms in BO are sequential, where only one experiment is selected at each iteration. This method can be time inefficient when each experiment takes a long time and more than one experiment can be ran concurrently. On the other hand, requesting a fix-sized batch of experiments at each iteration causes performance inefficiency in BO compared to the sequential policies. In this paper, we present an algorithm that asks a batch of experiments at each time step t where the batch size p_t is dynamically determined in each step. Our algorithm is based on the observation that the sequence of experiments selected by the sequential policy can sometimes be almost independent from each other. Our algorithm identifies such scenarios and request those experiments at the same time without degrading the performance. We evaluate our proposed method using the Expected Improvement policy and the results show substantial speedup with little impact on the performance in eight real and synthetic benchmarks.",Machine Learning
7833,Injecting External Solutions Into CMA-ES,"This report considers how to inject external candidate solutions into the CMA-ES algorithm. The injected solutions might stem from a gradient or a Newton step, a surrogate model optimizer or any other oracle or search mechanism. They can also be the result of a repair mechanism, for example to render infeasible solutions feasible. Only small modifications to the CMA-ES are necessary to turn injection into a reliable and effective method: too long steps need to be tightly renormalized. The main objective of this report is to reveal this simple mechanism. Depending on the source of the injected solutions, interesting variants of CMA-ES arise. When the best-ever solution is always (re-)injected, an elitist variant of CMA-ES with weighted multi-recombination arises. When \emph{all} solutions are injected from an \emph{external} source, the resulting algorithm might be viewed as \emph{adaptive encoding} with step-size control. In first experiments, injected solutions of very good quality lead to a convergence speed twice as fast as on the (simple) sphere function without injection. This means that we observe an impressive speed-up on otherwise difficult to solve functions. Single bad injected solutions on the other hand do no significant harm.",Machine Learning

In typical cases these kernels can be computed in nearly-linear time (in the amount of data), improving on the cubic time of the standard construction, enabling large scale semi-supervised learning in a variety of contexts. The methods are validated on semi-supervised and unsupervised problems on data sets containing upto 64,000 sample points.",Machine Learning
7835,"Learning Hierarchical and Topographic Dictionaries with Structured
  Sparsity","Recent work in signal processing and statistics have focused on defining new regularization functions, which not only induce sparsity of the solution, but also take into account the structure of the problem. We present in this paper a class of convex penalties introduced in the machine learning community, which take the form of a sum of l_2 and l_infinity-norms over groups of variables. They extend the classical group-sparsity regularization in the sense that the groups possibly overlap, allowing more flexibility in the group design. We review efficient optimization methods to deal with the corresponding inverse problems, and their application to the problem of learning dictionaries of natural image patches: On the one hand, dictionary learning has indeed proven effective for various signal processing tasks. On the other hand, structured sparsity provides a natural framework for modeling dependencies between dictionary elements. We thus consider a structured sparse regularization to learn dictionaries embedded in a particular structure, for instance a tree or a two-dimensional grid. In the latter case, the results we obtain are similar to the dictionaries produced by topographic independent component analysis.",Machine Learning

  Multiarmed Bandits","We develop a new tool for data-dependent analysis of the exploration-exploitation trade-off in learning under limited feedback. Our tool is based on two main ingredients. The first ingredient is a new concentration inequality that makes it possible to control the concentration of weighted averages of multiple (possibly uncountably many) simultaneously evolving and interdependent martingales. The second ingredient is an application of this inequality to the exploration-exploitation trade-off via importance weighted sampling. We apply the new tool to the stochastic multiarmed bandit problem, however, the main importance of this paper is the development and understanding of the new tool rather than improvement of existing algorithms for stochastic multiarmed bandits. In the follow-up work we demonstrate that the new tool can improve over state-of-the-art in structurally richer problems, such as stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information (Seldin et al., 2011a).",Machine Learning
7839,Confidence Estimation in Structured Prediction,"Structured classification tasks such as sequence labeling and dependency parsing have seen much interest by the Natural Language Processing and the machine learning communities. Several online learning algorithms were adapted for structured tasks such as Perceptron, Passive- Aggressive and the recently introduced Confidence-Weighted learning . These online algorithms are easy to implement, fast to train and yield state-of-the-art performance. However, unlike probabilistic models like Hidden Markov Model and Conditional random fields, these methods generate models that output merely a prediction with no additional information regarding confidence in the correctness of the output. In this work we fill the gap proposing few alternatives to compute the confidence in the output of non-probabilistic algorithms.We show how to compute confidence estimates in the prediction such that the confidence reflects the probability that the word is labeled correctly. We then show how to use our methods to detect mislabeled words, trade recall for precision and active learning. We evaluate our methods on four noun-phrase chunking and named entity recognition sequence labeling tasks, and on dependency parsing for 14 languages.",Machine Learning

Such queries have been quite useful in applications, but have been lacking theoretical understanding. In this work, we characterize the power of such queries under two well-known noise models. We give nearly tight upper and lower bounds on the number of queries needed to learn both for the general agnostic setting and for the bounded noise model. We further show that our methods can be made adaptive to the (unknown) noise rate, with only negligible loss in query complexity.",Machine Learning
7841,Parametrized Stochastic Multi-armed Bandits with Binary Rewards,"In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-armed bandits with a large, possibly infinite number of correlated arms. We assume that the arms have Bernoulli distributed rewards, independent across time, where the probabilities of success are parametrized by known attribute vectors for each arm, as well as an unknown preference vector, each of dimension $n$. For this model, we seek an algorithm with a total regret that is sub-linear in time and independent of the number of arms. We present such an algorithm, which we call the Two-Phase Algorithm, and analyze its performance. We show upper bounds on the total regret which applies uniformly in time, for both the finite and infinite arm cases. The asymptotics of the finite arm bound show that for any $f \in \omega(\log(T))$, the total regret can be made to be $O(n \cdot f(T))$. In the infinite arm case, the total regret is $O(\sqrt{n^3 T})$.",Machine Learning
7842,"Efficient Regression in Metric Spaces via Approximate Lipschitz
  Extension","We present a framework for performing efficient regression in general metric spaces. Roughly speaking, our regressor predicts the value at a new point by computing a Lipschitz extension --- the smoothest function consistent with the observed data --- after performing structural risk minimization to avoid overfitting. We obtain finite-sample risk bounds with minimal structural and noise assumptions, and a natural speed-precision tradeoff. The offline (learning) and online (prediction) stages can be solved by convex programming, but this naive approach has runtime complexity $O(n^3)$, which is prohibitive for large datasets. We design instead a regression algorithm whose speed and generalization performance depend on the intrinsic dimension of the data, to which the algorithm adapts. While our main innovation is algorithmic, the statistical results may also be of independent interest.",Machine Learning
7843,Large Scale Spectral Clustering Using Approximate Commute Time Embedding,"Spectral clustering is a novel clustering method which can detect complex shapes of data clusters. However, it requires the eigen decomposition of the graph Laplacian matrix, which is proportion to $O(n^3)$ and thus is not suitable for large scale systems. Recently, many methods have been proposed to accelerate the computational time of spectral clustering. These approximate methods usually involve sampling techniques by which a lot information of the original data may be lost. In this work, we propose a fast and accurate spectral clustering approach using an approximate commute time embedding, which is similar to the spectral embedding. The method does not require using any sampling technique and computing any eigenvector at all. Instead it uses random projection and a linear time solver to find the approximate embedding. The experiments in several synthetic and real datasets show that the proposed approach has better clustering quality and is faster than the state-of-the-art approximate spectral clustering methods.",Machine Learning
7844,"Trading Regret for Efficiency: Online Convex Optimization with Long Term
  Constraints","In this paper we propose a framework for solving constrained online convex optimization problem. Our motivation stems from the observation that most algorithms proposed for online convex optimization require a projection onto the convex set $\mathcal{K}$ from which the decisions are made. While for simple shapes (e.g. Euclidean ball) the projection is straightforward, for arbitrary complex sets this is the main computational challenge and may be inefficient in practice. In this paper, we consider an alternative online convex optimization problem. Instead of requiring decisions belong to $\mathcal{K}$ for all rounds, we only require that the constraints which define the set $\mathcal{K}$ be satisfied in the long run. We show that our framework can be utilized to solve a relaxed version of online learning with side constraints addressed in \cite{DBLP:conf/colt/MannorT06} and \cite{DBLP:conf/aaai/KvetonYTM08}. By turning the problem into an online convex-concave optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm which achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret bound and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ bound for the violation of constraints. Then we modify the algorithm in order to guarantee that the constraints are satisfied in the long run. This gain is achieved at the price of getting $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound. Our second algorithm is based on the Mirror Prox method \citep{nemirovski-2005-prox} to solve variational inequalities which achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{\mathcal{O}}}(T^{2/3})$ bound for both regret and the violation of constraints when the domain $\K$ can be described by a finite number of linear constraints. Finally, we extend the result to the setting where we only have partial access to the convex set $\mathcal{K}$ and propose a multipoint bandit feedback algorithm with the same bounds in expectation as our first algorithm.",Machine Learning
7845,Regret Bound by Variation for Online Convex Optimization,"In citep{Hazan-2008-extract}, the authors showed that the regret of online linear optimization can be bounded by the total variation of the cost vectors. In this paper, we extend this result to general online convex optimization. We first analyze the limitations of the algorithm in \citep{Hazan-2008-extract} when applied it to online convex optimization. We then present two algorithms for online convex optimization whose regrets are bounded by the variation of cost functions. We finally consider the bandit setting, and present a randomized algorithm for online bandit convex optimization with a variation-based regret bound. We show that the regret bound for online bandit convex optimization is optimal when the variation of cost functions is independent of the number of trials.",Machine Learning
7846,Learning in embodied action-perception loops through exploration,"Although exploratory behaviors are ubiquitous in the animal kingdom, their computational underpinnings are still largely unknown. Behavioral Psychology has identified learning as a primary drive underlying many exploratory behaviors. Exploration is seen as a means for an animal to gather sensory data useful for reducing its ignorance about the environment. While related problems have been addressed in Data Mining and Reinforcement Learning, the computational modeling of learning-driven exploration by embodied agents is largely unrepresented.   Here, we propose a computational theory for learning-driven exploration based on the concept of missing information that allows an agent to identify informative actions using Bayesian inference. We demonstrate that when embodiment constraints are high, agents must actively coordinate their actions to learn efficiently. Compared to earlier approaches, our exploration policy yields more efficient learning across a range of worlds with diverse structures. The improved learning in turn affords greater success in general tasks including navigation and reward gathering. We conclude by discussing how the proposed theory relates to previous information-theoretic objectives of behavior, such as predictive information and the free energy principle, and how it might contribute to a general theory of exploratory behavior.",Machine Learning

Bipartite ranking algorithm Smooth Rank implementing this approach is introduced. The advantages of this algorithm are demonstrated on two types of problems. First, Smooth Rank is applied to two-class problems from bio-medical field, where ranking is often preferable to classification. In comparison against SVMs with radial and linear kernels, Smooth Rank had the best performance on 8 out of 12 benchmark benchmarks. The second area of application is survival analysis, which is reduced here to bipartite ranking in a way which allows one to use commonly accepted measures of methods performance. In comparison of Smooth Rank with Cox PH regression and CoxPath methods, Smooth Rank proved to be the best on 9 out of 10 benchmark datasets.",Machine Learning

  Classification","We investigate a recently proposed family of positive-definite kernels that mimic the computation in large neural networks. We examine the properties of these kernels using tools from differential geometry; specifically, we analyze the geometry of surfaces in Hilbert space that are induced by these kernels. When this geometry is described by a Riemannian manifold, we derive results for the metric, curvature, and volume element. Interestingly, though, we find that the simplest kernel in this family does not admit such an interpretation. We explore two variations of these kernels that mimic computation in neural networks with different activation functions. We experiment with these new kernels on several data sets and highlight their general trends in performance for classification.",Machine Learning
7850,"Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Semi-supervised Dimensionality
  Reduction","We show how to incorporate information from labeled examples into nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF), a popular unsupervised learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction. In addition to mapping the data into a space of lower dimensionality, our approach aims to preserve the nonnegative components of the data that are important for classification. We identify these components from the support vectors of large-margin classifiers and derive iterative updates to preserve them in a semi-supervised version of NMF. These updates have a simple multiplicative form like their unsupervised counterparts; they are also guaranteed at each iteration to decrease their loss function---a weighted sum of I-divergences that captures the trade-off between unsupervised and supervised learning. We evaluate these updates for dimensionality reduction when they are used as a precursor to linear classification. In this role, we find that they yield much better performance than their unsupervised counterparts. We also find one unexpected benefit of the low dimensional representations discovered by our approach: often they yield more accurate classifiers than both ordinary and transductive SVMs trained in the original input space.",Machine Learning

  Matrix Factorization","This paper provides a theoretical support for clustering aspect of the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). By utilizing the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions, we show that NMF objective is equivalent to graph clustering objective, so clustering aspect of the NMF has a solid justification. Different from previous approaches which usually discard the nonnegativity constraints, our approach guarantees the stationary point being used in deriving the equivalence is located on the feasible region in the nonnegative orthant. Additionally, since clustering capability of a matrix decomposition technique can sometimes imply its latent semantic indexing (LSI) aspect, we will also evaluate LSI aspect of the NMF by showing its capability in solving the synonymy and polysemy problems in synthetic datasets. And more extensive evaluation will be conducted by comparing LSI performances of the NMF and the singular value decomposition (SVD), the standard LSI method, using some standard datasets.",Machine Learning

It is also a complex task with many important methodological decisions to make. Among those, one of the most crucial is the choice of an appropriate measure in order to properly assess the classification performance and rank the algorithms. In this article, we focus on this specific task. We present the most popular measures and compare their behavior through discrimination plots. We then discuss their properties from a more theoretical perspective. It turns out several of them are equivalent for classifiers comparison purposes. Futhermore. they can also lead to interpretation problems. Among the numerous measures proposed over the years, it appears that the classical overall success rate and marginal rates are the more suitable for classifier comparison task.",Machine Learning
7853,"Modeling transition dynamics in MDPs with RKHS embeddings of conditional
  distributions","We propose a new, nonparametric approach to estimating the value function in reinforcement learning. This approach makes use of a recently developed representation of conditional distributions as functions in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Such representations bypass the need for estimating transition probabilities, and apply to any domain on which kernels can be defined. Our approach avoids the need to approximate intractable integrals since expectations are represented as RKHS inner products whose computation has linear complexity in the sample size. Thus, we can efficiently perform value function estimation in a wide variety of settings, including finite state spaces, continuous states spaces, and partially observable tasks where only sensor measurements are available. A second advantage of the approach is that we learn the conditional distribution representation from a training sample, and do not require an exhaustive exploration of the state space. We prove convergence of our approach either to the optimal policy, or to the closest projection of the optimal policy in our model class, under reasonable assumptions. In experiments, we demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a learning task in a continuous state space (the under-actuated pendulum), and on a navigation problem where only images from a sensor are observed. We compare with least-squares policy iteration where a Gaussian process is used for value function estimation. Our algorithm achieves better performance in both tasks.",Machine Learning

In this work we examine the notion of combining one-class classifiers as an alternative for selecting the best classifier. In particular, we propose two new one-class classification performance measures to weigh classifiers and show that a simple ensemble that implements these measures can outperform the most popular one-class ensembles. Furthermore, we propose a new one-class ensemble scheme, TUPSO, which uses meta-learning to combine one-class classifiers. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of TUPSO over all other tested ensembles and show that the TUPSO performance is statistically indistinguishable from that of the hypothetical best classifier.",Machine Learning
7855,Building high-level features using large scale unsupervised learning,"We consider the problem of building high-level, class-specific feature detectors from only unlabeled data. For example, is it possible to learn a face detector using only unlabeled images? To answer this, we train a 9-layered locally connected sparse autoencoder with pooling and local contrast normalization on a large dataset of images (the model has 1 billion connections, the dataset has 10 million 200x200 pixel images downloaded from the Internet). We train this network using model parallelism and asynchronous SGD on a cluster with 1,000 machines (16,000 cores) for three days. Contrary to what appears to be a widely-held intuition, our experimental results reveal that it is possible to train a face detector without having to label images as containing a face or not. Control experiments show that this feature detector is robust not only to translation but also to scaling and out-of-plane rotation. We also find that the same network is sensitive to other high-level concepts such as cat faces and human bodies. Starting with these learned features, we trained our network to obtain 15.8% accuracy in recognizing 20,000 object categories from ImageNet, a leap of 70% relative improvement over the previous state-of-the-art.",Machine Learning
7856,Two-Manifold Problems,"Recently, there has been much interest in spectral approaches to learning manifolds---so-called kernel eigenmap methods. These methods have had some successes, but their applicability is limited because they are not robust to noise. To address this limitation, we look at two-manifold problems, in which we simultaneously reconstruct two related manifolds, each representing a different view of the same data. By solving these interconnected learning problems together and allowing information to flow between them, two-manifold algorithms are able to succeed where a non-integrated approach would fail: each view allows us to suppress noise in the other, reducing bias in the same way that an instrumental variable allows us to remove bias in a {linear} dimensionality reduction problem. We propose a class of algorithms for two-manifold problems, based on spectral decomposition of cross-covariance operators in Hilbert space. Finally, we discuss situations where two-manifold problems are useful, and demonstrate that solving a two-manifold problem can aid in learning a nonlinear dynamical system from limited data.",Machine Learning
7857,T-Learning,"Traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) has focused on problems involving many states and few actions, such as simple grid worlds. Most real world problems, however, are of the opposite type, Involving Few relevant states and many actions. For example, to return home from a conference, humans identify only few subgoal states such as lobby, taxi, airport etc. Each valid behavior connecting two such states can be viewed as an action, and there are trillions of them. Assuming the subgoal identification problem is already solved, the quality of any RL method---in real-world settings---depends less on how well it scales with the number of states than on how well it scales with the number of actions. This is where our new method T-Learning excels, by evaluating the relatively few possible transits from one state to another in a policy-independent way, rather than a huge number of state-action pairs, or states in traditional policy-dependent ways. Illustrative experiments demonstrate that performance improvements of T-Learning over Q-learning can be arbitrarily large.",Machine Learning

In this study, we investigate a novel automatic approach to diagnose Diabetes disease based on Feature Weighted Support Vector Machines (FW-SVMs) and Modified Cuckoo Search (MCS). The proposed model consists of three stages: Firstly, PCA is applied to select an optimal subset of features out of set of all the features. Secondly, Mutual Information is employed to construct the FWSVM by weighting different features based on their degree of importance. Finally, since parameter selection plays a vital role in classification accuracy of SVMs, MCS is applied to select the best parameter values.

However, using acoustical features of classrooms as a way to provide education systems with feedback about the learning process was not thoroughly investigated in any of these studies. We propose a system that extracts different sound features of students and instructors, and then uses machine learning techniques to evaluate the acoustical quality of any learning environment. We infer conclusions about the students' satisfaction with the quality of lectures. Using classifiers instead of surveys and other subjective ways of measures can facilitate and speed such experiments which enables us to perform them continuously.

Previous studies on efficient empirical loss minimization assume either a smooth loss function or a strongly convex regularizer, making them unsuitable for non-smooth optimization. We develop a simple yet efficient method for a family of non-smooth optimization problems where the dual form of the loss function is bilinear in primal and dual variables. We cast a non-smooth optimization problem into a minimax optimization problem, and develop a primal dual prox method that solves the minimax optimization problem at a rate of $O(1/T)$ {assuming that the proximal step can be efficiently solved}, significantly faster than a standard subgradient descent method that has an $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate. Our empirical study verifies the efficiency of the proposed method for various non-smooth optimization problems that arise ubiquitously in machine learning by comparing it to the state-of-the-art first order methods.",Machine Learning
7864,"A Comparison Between Data Mining Prediction Algorithms for Fault
  Detection(Case study: Ahanpishegan co.)","In the current competitive world, industrial companies seek to manufacture products of higher quality which can be achieved by increasing reliability, maintainability and thus the availability of products. On the other hand, improvement in products lifecycle is necessary for achieving high reliability. Typically, maintenance activities are aimed to reduce failures of industrial machinery and minimize the consequences of such failures. So the industrial companies try to improve their efficiency by using different fault detection techniques. One strategy is to process and analyze previous generated data to predict future failures. The purpose of this paper is to detect wasted parts using different data mining algorithms and compare the accuracy of these algorithms. A combination of thermal and physical characteristics has been used and the algorithms were implemented on Ahanpishegan's current data to estimate the availability of its produced parts.

7865,"Active Learning of Custering with Side Information Using $\eps$-Smooth
  Relative Regret Approximations","Clustering is considered a non-supervised learning setting, in which the goal is to partition a collection of data points into disjoint clusters. Often a bound $k$ on the number of clusters is given or assumed by the practitioner. Many versions of this problem have been defined, most notably $k$-means and $k$-median.   An underlying problem with the unsupervised nature of clustering it that of determining a similarity function. One approach for alleviating this difficulty is known as clustering with side information, alternatively, semi-supervised clustering. Here, the practitioner incorporates side information in the form of ""must be clustered"" or ""must be separated"" labels for data point pairs. Each such piece of information comes at a ""query cost"" (often involving human response solicitation). The collection of labels is then incorporated in the usual clustering algorithm as either strict or as soft constraints, possibly adding a pairwise constraint penalty function to the chosen clustering objective.   Our work is mostly related to clustering with side information. We ask how to choose the pairs of data points. Our analysis gives rise to a method provably better than simply choosing them uniformly at random. Roughly speaking, we show that the distribution must be biased so as more weight is placed on pairs incident to elements in smaller clusters in some optimal solution. Of course we do not know the optimal solution, hence we don't know the bias. Using the recently introduced method of $\eps$-smooth relative regret approximations of Ailon, Begleiter and Ezra, we can show an iterative process that improves both the clustering and the bias in tandem. The process provably converges to the optimal solution faster (in terms of query cost) than an algorithm selecting pairs uniformly.",Machine Learning
7866,Contextual Bandit Learning with Predictable Rewards,"Contextual bandit learning is a reinforcement learning problem where the learner repeatedly receives a set of features (context), takes an action and receives a reward based on the action and context. We consider this problem under a realizability assumption: there exists a function in a (known) function class, always capable of predicting the expected reward, given the action and context. Under this assumption, we show three things. We present a new algorithm---Regressor Elimination--- with a regret similar to the agnostic setting (i.e. in the absence of realizability assumption). We prove a new lower bound showing no algorithm can achieve superior performance in the worst case even with the realizability assumption. However, we do show that for any set of policies (mapping contexts to actions), there is a distribution over rewards (given context) such that our new algorithm has constant regret unlike the previous approaches.",Machine Learning
7867,On the Performance of Maximum Likelihood Inverse Reinforcement Learning,"Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) addresses the problem of recovering a task description given a demonstration of the optimal policy used to solve such a task. The optimal policy is usually provided by an expert or teacher, making IRL specially suitable for the problem of apprenticeship learning. The task description is encoded in the form of a reward function of a Markov decision process (MDP). Several algorithms have been proposed to find the reward function corresponding to a set of demonstrations. One of the algorithms that has provided best results in different applications is a gradient method to optimize a policy squared error criterion. On a parallel line of research, other authors have presented recently a gradient approximation of the maximum likelihood estimate of the reward signal. In general, both approaches approximate the gradient estimate and the criteria at different stages to make the algorithm tractable and efficient. In this work, we provide a detailed description of the different methods to highlight differences in terms of reward estimation, policy similarity and computational costs. We also provide experimental results to evaluate the differences in performance of the methods.",Machine Learning
7868,PAC Bounds for Discounted MDPs,We study upper and lower bounds on the sample-complexity of learning near-optimal behaviour in finite-state discounted Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). For the upper bound we make the assumption that each action leads to at most two possible next-states and prove a new bound for a UCRL-style algorithm on the number of time-steps when it is not Probably Approximately Correct (PAC). The new lower bound strengthens previous work by being both more general (it applies to all policies) and tighter. The upper and lower bounds match up to logarithmic factors.,Machine Learning
7869,Confusion Matrix Stability Bounds for Multiclass Classification,"In this paper, we provide new theoretical results on the generalization properties of learning algorithms for multiclass classification problems. The originality of our work is that we propose to use the confusion matrix of a classifier as a measure of its quality; our contribution is in the line of work which attempts to set up and study the statistical properties of new evaluation measures such as, e.g. ROC curves. In the confusion-based learning framework we propose, we claim that a targetted objective is to minimize the size of the confusion matrix C, measured through its operator norm ||C||. We derive generalization bounds on the (size of the) confusion matrix in an extended framework of uniform stability, adapted to the case of matrix valued loss. Pivotal to our study is a very recent matrix concentration inequality that generalizes McDiarmid's inequality. As an illustration of the relevance of our theoretical results, we show how two SVM learning procedures can be proved to be confusion-friendly. To the best of our knowledge, the present paper is the first that focuses on the confusion matrix from a theoretical point of view.",Machine Learning

To improve the accuracy of classification, we propose to determine the optimal size of the training set and perform feature selection. To find the optimal size of the training set, different sizes of training sets are experimented and the one with highest classification rate is selected. The optimal features are selected through their F-Scores.",Machine Learning
7871,On the Necessity of Irrelevant Variables,"This work explores the effects of relevant and irrelevant boolean variables on the accuracy of classifiers. The analysis uses the assumption that the variables are conditionally independent given the class, and focuses on a natural family of learning algorithms for such sources when the relevant variables have a small advantage over random guessing. The main result is that algorithms relying predominately on irrelevant variables have error probabilities that quickly go to 0 in situations where algorithms that limit the use of irrelevant variables have errors bounded below by a positive constant. We also show that accurate learning is possible even when there are so few examples that one cannot determine with high confidence whether or not any individual variable is relevant.",Machine Learning

Classification methods like decision trees, Bayesian network etc can be applied on the educational data for predicting the student's performance in examination. This prediction will help to identify the weak students and help them to score better marks. The C4.5, ID3 and CART decision tree algorithms are applied on engineering student's data to predict their performance in the final exam. The outcome of the decision tree predicted the number of students who are likely to pass, fail or promoted to next year. The results provide steps to improve the performance of the students who were predicted to fail or promoted.

We use unnormalized relative entropy and relative entropy to define two different Bregman divergences that produce an unnormalized exponentiated gradient update and a normalized exponentiated gradient update on the mixture weights, respectively. We then carry out the mean and the mean-square transient analysis of these adaptive algorithms when they are used to combine outputs of $m$ constituent filters. We illustrate the accuracy of our results and demonstrate the effectiveness of these updates for sparse mixture systems.",Machine Learning

  Modeling","The past century was era of linear systems. Either systems (especially industrial ones) were simple (quasi)linear or linear approximations were accurate enough. In addition, just at the ending decades of the century profusion of computing devices were available, before then due to lack of computational resources it was not easy to evaluate available nonlinear system studies. At the moment both these two conditions changed, systems are highly complex and also pervasive amount of computation strength is cheap and easy to achieve. For recent era, a new branch of supervised learning well known as surrogate modeling (meta-modeling, surface modeling) has been devised which aimed at answering new needs of modeling realm. This short literature survey is on to introduce surrogate modeling to whom is familiar with the concepts of supervised learning. Necessity, challenges and visions of the topic are considered.",Machine Learning
7875,Credal Classification based on AODE and compression coefficients,"Bayesian model averaging (BMA) is an approach to average over alternative models; yet, it usually gets excessively concentrated around the single most probable model, therefore achieving only sub-optimal classification performance. The compression-based approach (Boulle, 2007) overcomes this problem, averaging over the different models by applying a logarithmic smoothing over the models' posterior probabilities. This approach has shown excellent performances when applied to ensembles of naive Bayes classifiers. AODE is another ensemble of models with high performance (Webb, 2005), based on a collection of non-naive classifiers (called SPODE) whose probabilistic predictions are aggregated by simple arithmetic mean. Aggregating the SPODEs via BMA rather than by arithmetic mean deteriorates the performance; instead, we aggregate the SPODEs via the compression coefficients and we show that the resulting classifier obtains a slight but consistent improvement over AODE. However, an important issue in any Bayesian ensemble of models is the arbitrariness in the choice of the prior over the models. We address this problem by the paradigm of credal classification, namely by substituting the unique prior with a set of priors. Credal classifier automatically recognize the prior-dependent instances, namely the instances whose most probable class varies, when different priors are considered; in these cases, credal classifiers remain reliable by returning a set of classes rather than a single class. We thus develop the credal version of both the BMA-based and the compression-based ensemble of SPODEs, substituting the single prior over the models by a set of priors. Experiments show that both credal classifiers provide higher classification reliability than their determinate counterparts; moreover the compression-based credal classifier compares favorably to previous credal classifiers.",Machine Learning

7877,Stochastic Feature Mapping for PAC-Bayes Classification,"Probabilistic generative modeling of data distributions can potentially exploit hidden information which is useful for discriminative classification. This observation has motivated the development of approaches that couple generative and discriminative models for classification. In this paper, we propose a new approach to couple generative and discriminative models in an unified framework based on PAC-Bayes risk theory. We first derive the model-parameter-independent stochastic feature mapping from a practical MAP classifier operating on generative models. Then we construct a linear stochastic classifier equipped with the feature mapping, and derive the explicit PAC-Bayes risk bounds for such classifier for both supervised and semi-supervised learning. Minimizing the risk bound, using an EM-like iterative procedure, results in a new posterior over hidden variables (E-step) and the update rules of model parameters (M-step). The derivation of the posterior is always feasible due to the way of equipping feature mapping and the explicit form of bounding risk. The derived posterior allows the tuning of generative models and subsequently the feature mappings for better classification. The derived update rules of the model parameters are same to those of the uncoupled models as the feature mapping is model-parameter-independent. Our experiments show that the coupling between data modeling generative model and the discriminative classifier via a stochastic feature mapping in this framework leads to a general classification tool with state-of-the-art performance.",Machine Learning

Indeed, many works propose to learn new knowledge from examples that translate the expected behaviour of the considered system. A key issue of supervised learning concerns the description language used to represent the examples. In this paper, we propose a method to evaluate the feature set used to describe them. Our method is based on the computation of the consistency of the example base. We carried out a case study in the domain of geomatic in order to evaluate the sets of measures used to characterise geographic objects. The case study shows that our method allows to give relevant evaluations of measure sets.",Machine Learning
7879,Minimax Classifier for Uncertain Costs,"Many studies on the cost-sensitive learning assumed that a unique cost matrix is known for a problem. However, this assumption may not hold for many real-world problems. For example, a classifier might need to be applied in several circumstances, each of which associates with a different cost matrix. Or, different human experts have different opinions about the costs for a given problem. Motivated by these facts, this study aims to seek the minimax classifier over multiple cost matrices. In summary, we theoretically proved that, no matter how many cost matrices are involved, the minimax problem can be tackled by solving a number of standard cost-sensitive problems and sub-problems that involve only two cost matrices. As a result, a general framework for achieving minimax classifier over multiple cost matrices is suggested and justified by preliminary empirical studies.",Machine Learning

  Neighbor Voting","Multiple instance learning (MIL) has attracted great attention recently in machine learning community. However, most MIL algorithms are very slow and cannot be applied to large datasets. In this paper, we propose a greedy strategy to speed up the multiple instance learning process. Our contribution is two fold. First, we propose a density ratio model, and show that maximizing a density ratio function is the low bound of the DD model under certain conditions. Secondly, we make use of a histogram ratio between positive bags and negative bags to represent the density ratio function and find codebooks separately for positive bags and negative bags by a greedy strategy. For testing, we make use of a nearest neighbor strategy to classify new bags. We test our method on both small benchmark datasets and the large TRECVID MED11 dataset. The experimental results show that our method yields comparable accuracy to the current state of the art, while being up to at least one order of magnitude faster.",Machine Learning

  Factorization with Automatic Regularization Parameters Determination","We present a converged algorithm for Tikhonov regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). We specially choose this regularization because it is known that Tikhonov regularized least square (LS) is the more preferable form in solving linear inverse problems than the conventional LS. Because an NMF problem can be decomposed into LS subproblems, it can be expected that Tikhonov regularized NMF will be the more appropriate approach in solving NMF problems. The algorithm is derived using additive update rules which have been shown to have convergence guarantee. We equip the algorithm with a mechanism to automatically determine the regularization parameters based on the L-curve, a well-known concept in the inverse problems community, but is rather unknown in the NMF research. The introduction of this algorithm thus solves two inherent problems in Tikhonov regularized NMF algorithm research, i.e., convergence guarantee and regularization parameters determination.",Machine Learning
7882,Efficient Constrained Regret Minimization,"Online learning constitutes a mathematical and compelling framework to analyze sequential decision making problems in adversarial environments. The learner repeatedly chooses an action, the environment responds with an outcome, and then the learner receives a reward for the played action. The goal of the learner is to maximize his total reward. However, there are situations in which, in addition to maximizing the cumulative reward, there are some additional constraints on the sequence of decisions that must be satisfied on average by the learner. In this paper we study an extension to the online learning where the learner aims to maximize the total reward given that some additional constraints need to be satisfied. By leveraging on the theory of Lagrangian method in constrained optimization, we propose Lagrangian exponentially weighted average (LEWA) algorithm, which is a primal-dual variant of the well known exponentially weighted average algorithm, to efficiently solve constrained online decision making problems. Using novel theoretical analysis, we establish the regret and the violation of the constraint bounds in full information and bandit feedback models.",Machine Learning
7883,A Uniqueness Theorem for Clustering,"Despite the widespread use of Clustering, there is distressingly little general theory of clustering available. Questions like ""What distinguishes a clustering of data from other data partitioning?"", ""Are there any principles governing all clustering paradigms?"", ""How should a user choose an appropriate clustering algorithm for a particular task?"", etc. are almost completely unanswered by the existing body of clustering literature. We consider an axiomatic approach to the theory of Clustering. We adopt the framework of Kleinberg, [Kle03]. By relaxing one of Kleinberg's clustering axioms, we sidestep his impossibility result and arrive at a consistent set of axioms. We suggest to extend these axioms, aiming to provide an axiomatic taxonomy of clustering paradigms. Such a taxonomy should provide users some guidance concerning the choice of the appropriate clustering paradigm for a given task. The main result of this paper is a set of abstract properties that characterize the Single-Linkage clustering function. This characterization result provides new insight into the properties of desired data groupings that make Single-Linkage the appropriate choice. We conclude by considering a taxonomy of clustering functions based on abstract properties that each satisfies.",Machine Learning
7884,The Entire Quantile Path of a Risk-Agnostic SVM Classifier,"A quantile binary classifier uses the rule: Classify x as +1 if P(Y = 1|X = x) >= t, and as -1 otherwise, for a fixed quantile parameter t {[0, 1]. It has been shown that Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in the limit are quantile classifiers with t = 1/2 . In this paper, we show that by using asymmetric cost of misclassification SVMs can be appropriately extended to recover, in the limit, the quantile binary classifier for any t. We then present a principled algorithm to solve the extended SVM classifier for all values of t simultaneously. This has two implications: First, one can recover the entire conditional distribution P(Y = 1|X = x) = t for t {[0, 1]. Second, we can build a risk-agnostic SVM classifier where the cost of misclassification need not be known apriori. Preliminary numerical experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",Machine Learning

Our main result is an approximation scheme for the partition function based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo theory. We also show that the efficient uniform sampling assumption holds in several application settings that are of importance in machine learning.",Machine Learning

The algorithm proceeds in episodes where, in each episode, it picks a policy using regularization based on the span of the optimal bias vector. For an MDP with S states and A actions whose optimal bias vector has span bounded by H, we show a regret bound of ~O(HSpAT). We also relate the span to various diameter-like quantities associated with the MDP, demonstrating how our results improve on previous regret bounds.",Machine Learning
7887,A Bayesian Sampling Approach to Exploration in Reinforcement Learning,"We present a modular approach to reinforcement learning that uses a Bayesian representation of the uncertainty over models. The approach, BOSS (Best of Sampled Set), drives exploration by sampling multiple models from the posterior and selecting actions optimistically. It extends previous work by providing a rule for deciding when to resample and how to combine the models. We show that our algorithm achieves nearoptimal reward with high probability with a sample complexity that is low relative to the speed at which the posterior distribution converges during learning. We demonstrate that BOSS performs quite favorably compared to state-of-the-art reinforcement-learning approaches and illustrate its flexibility by pairing it with a non-parametric model that generalizes across states.",Machine Learning
7888,Decoupling Exploration and Exploitation in Multi-Armed Bandits,"We consider a multi-armed bandit problem where the decision maker can explore and exploit different arms at every round. The exploited arm adds to the decision maker's cumulative reward (without necessarily observing the reward) while the explored arm reveals its value. We devise algorithms for this setup and show that the dependence on the number of arms, k, can be much better than the standard square root of k dependence, depending on the behavior of the arms' reward sequences. For the important case of piecewise stationary stochastic bandits, we show a significant improvement over existing algorithms. Our algorithms are based on a non-uniform sampling policy, which we show is essential to the success of any algorithm in the adversarial setup. Finally, we show some simulation results on an ultra-wide band channel selection inspired setting indicating the applicability of our algorithms.",Machine Learning
7889,"Normalized Maximum Likelihood Coding for Exponential Family with Its
  Applications to Optimal Clustering","We are concerned with the issue of how to calculate the normalized maximum likelihood (NML) code-length. There is a problem that the normalization term of the NML code-length may diverge when it is continuous and unbounded and a straightforward computation of it is highly expensive when the data domain is finite . In previous works it has been investigated how to calculate the NML code-length for specific types of distributions. We first propose a general method for computing the NML code-length for the exponential family. Then we specifically focus on Gaussian mixture model (GMM), and propose a new efficient method for computing the NML to them. We develop it by generalizing Rissanen's re-normalizing technique. Then we apply this method to the clustering issue, in which a clustering structure is modeled using a GMM, and the main task is to estimate the optimal number of clusters on the basis of the NML code-length. We demonstrate using artificial data sets the superiority of the NML-based clustering over other criteria such as AIC, BIC in terms of the data size required for high accuracy rate to be achieved.",Machine Learning

7891,The Role of Weight Shrinking in Large Margin Perceptron Learning,We introduce into the classical perceptron algorithm with margin a mechanism that shrinks the current weight vector as a first step of the update. If the shrinking factor is constant the resulting algorithm may be regarded as a margin-error-driven version of NORMA with constant learning rate. In this case we show that the allowed strength of shrinking depends on the value of the maximum margin. We also consider variable shrinking factors for which there is no such dependence. In both cases we obtain new generalizations of the perceptron with margin able to provably attain in a finite number of steps any desirable approximation of the maximal margin hyperplane. The new approximate maximum margin classifiers appear experimentally to be very competitive in 2-norm soft margin tasks involving linear kernels.,Machine Learning
7892,Safe Exploration in Markov Decision Processes,"In environments with uncertain dynamics exploration is necessary to learn how to perform well. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong exploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The essence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other state by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration algorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited before. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems would break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most physical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we address the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We first propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that imposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed safe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed safe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization formulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the guaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our framework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration methods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a Martian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore better than classical exploration methods.",Machine Learning
7893,Off-Policy Actor-Critic,"This paper presents the first actor-critic algorithm for off-policy reinforcement learning. Our algorithm is online and incremental, and its per-time-step complexity scales linearly with the number of learned weights. Previous work on actor-critic algorithms is limited to the on-policy setting and does not take advantage of the recent advances in off-policy gradient temporal-difference learning. Off-policy techniques, such as Greedy-GQ, enable a target policy to be learned while following and obtaining data from another (behavior) policy. For many problems, however, actor-critic methods are more practical than action value methods (like Greedy-GQ) because they explicitly represent the policy; consequently, the policy can be stochastic and utilize a large action space. In this paper, we illustrate how to practically combine the generality and learning potential of off-policy learning with the flexibility in action selection given by actor-critic methods. We derive an incremental, linear time and space complexity algorithm that includes eligibility traces, prove convergence under assumptions similar to previous off-policy algorithms, and empirically show better or comparable performance to existing algorithms on standard reinforcement-learning benchmark problems.",Machine Learning

  Implications","We theoretically analyze and compare the following five popular multiclass classification methods: One vs. All, All Pairs, Tree-based classifiers, Error Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) with randomly generated code matrices, and Multiclass SVM. In the first four methods, the classification is based on a reduction to binary classification. We consider the case where the binary classifier comes from a class of VC dimension $d$, and in particular from the class of halfspaces over $\reals^d$. We analyze both the estimation error and the approximation error of these methods. Our analysis reveals interesting conclusions of practical relevance, regarding the success of the different approaches under various conditions. Our proof technique employs tools from VC theory to analyze the \emph{approximation error} of hypothesis classes. This is in sharp contrast to most, if not all, previous uses of VC theory, which only deal with estimation error.",Machine Learning
7895,"An Optimization Framework for Semi-Supervised and Transfer Learning
  using Multiple Classifiers and Clusterers","Unsupervised models can provide supplementary soft constraints to help classify new, ""target"" data since similar instances in the target set are more likely to share the same class label. Such models can also help detect possible differences between training and target distributions, which is useful in applications where concept drift may take place, as in transfer learning settings. This paper describes a general optimization framework that takes as input class membership estimates from existing classifiers learnt on previously encountered ""source"" data, as well as a similarity matrix from a cluster ensemble operating solely on the target data to be classified, and yields a consensus labeling of the target data. This framework admits a wide range of loss functions and classification/clustering methods. It exploits properties of Bregman divergences in conjunction with Legendre duality to yield a principled and scalable approach. A variety of experiments show that the proposed framework can yield results substantially superior to those provided by popular transductive learning techniques or by naively applying classifiers learnt on the original task to the target data.",Machine Learning

In our setting, there are a few types of users, each with a specific response to the different arms. When a user enters the system, his type is unknown to the decision maker. The decision maker can either treat each user separately ignoring the previously observed users, or can attempt to take advantage of knowing that only few types exist and cluster the users according to their response to the arms. We devise algorithms that combine the usual exploration-exploitation tradeoff with clustering of users and demonstrate the value of clustering.

However, some limitations could prevent them from working effectively in certain domains. For example, many existing approaches are intrinsically unsupervised, which does not incorporate side information (e.g., class labels) to produce task specific decompositions; also, they typically work ""transductively"", i.e., the factorization does not generalize to new samples, so the complete factorization needs to be recomputed when new samples become available. To solve these problems, in this paper we propose an""inductive""-flavored method for low-rank kernel decomposition with priors. We achieve this by generalizing the Nystr\""om method in a novel way. On the one hand, our approach employs a highly flexible, nonparametric structure that allows us to generalize the low-rank factors to arbitrarily new samples; on the other hand, it has linear time and space complexities, which can be orders of magnitudes faster than existing approaches and renders great efficiency in learning a low-rank kernel decomposition. Empirical results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of the proposed method.",Machine Learning
7902,Path Integral Policy Improvement with Covariance Matrix Adaptation,"There has been a recent focus in reinforcement learning on addressing continuous state and action problems by optimizing parameterized policies. PI2 is a recent example of this approach. It combines a derivation from first principles of stochastic optimal control with tools from statistical estimation theory. In this paper, we consider PI2 as a member of the wider family of methods which share the concept of probability-weighted averaging to iteratively update parameters to optimize a cost function. We compare PI2 to other members of the same family - Cross-Entropy Methods and CMAES - at the conceptual level and in terms of performance. The comparison suggests the derivation of a novel algorithm which we call PI2-CMA for ""Path Integral Policy Improvement with Covariance Matrix Adaptation"". PI2-CMA's main advantage is that it determines the magnitude of the exploration noise automatically.",Machine Learning
7903,Optimizing F-measure: A Tale of Two Approaches,"F-measures are popular performance metrics, particularly for tasks with imbalanced data sets. Algorithms for learning to maximize F-measures follow two approaches: the empirical utility maximization (EUM) approach learns a classifier having optimal performance on training data, while the decision-theoretic approach learns a probabilistic model and then predicts labels with maximum expected F-measure. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical justifications and connections for these two approaches, and we study the conditions under which one approach is preferable to the other using synthetic and real datasets. Given accurate models, our results suggest that the two approaches are asymptotically equivalent given large training and test sets. Nevertheless, empirically, the EUM approach appears to be more robust against model misspecification, and given a good model, the decision-theoretic approach appears to be better for handling rare classes and a common domain adaptation scenario.",Machine Learning
7904,Multiple Kernel Learning from Noisy Labels by Stochastic Programming,"We study the problem of multiple kernel learning from noisy labels. This is in contrast to most of the previous studies on multiple kernel learning that mainly focus on developing efficient algorithms and assume perfectly labeled training examples. Directly applying the existing multiple kernel learning algorithms to noisily labeled examples often leads to suboptimal performance due to the incorrect class assignments. We address this challenge by casting multiple kernel learning from noisy labels into a stochastic programming problem, and presenting a minimax formulation. We develop an efficient algorithm for solving the related convex-concave optimization problem with a fast convergence rate of $O(1/T)$ where $T$ is the number of iterations. Empirical studies on UCI data sets verify both the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the efficiency of the proposed optimization algorithm.",Machine Learning
7905,Efficient Decomposed Learning for Structured Prediction,"Structured prediction is the cornerstone of several machine learning applications. Unfortunately, in structured prediction settings with expressive inter-variable interactions, exact inference-based learning algorithms, e.g. Structural SVM, are often intractable. We present a new way, Decomposed Learning (DecL), which performs efficient learning by restricting the inference step to a limited part of the structured spaces. We provide characterizations based on the structure, target parameters, and gold labels, under which DecL is equivalent to exact learning. We then show that in real world settings, where our theoretical assumptions may not completely hold, DecL-based algorithms are significantly more efficient and as accurate as exact learning.",Machine Learning
9291,Directional Consistency for Continuous Numerical Constraints,"Bounds consistency is usually enforced on continuous constraints by first decomposing them into binary and ternary primitives. This decomposition has long been shown to drastically slow down the computation of solutions. To tackle this, Benhamou et al. have introduced an algorithm that avoids formally decomposing constraints. Its better efficiency compared to the former method has already been experimentally demonstrated. It is shown here that their algorithm implements a strategy to enforce on a continuous constraint a consistency akin to Directional Bounds Consistency as introduced by Dechter and Pearl for discrete problems. The algorithm is analyzed in this framework, and compared with algorithms that enforce bounds consistency. These theoretical results are eventually contrasted with new experimental results on standard benchmarks from the interval constraint community.",Artificial Intelligence
11009,Secure Component Deployment in the OSGi(tm) Release 4 Platform,"Last years have seen a dramatic increase in the use of component platforms, not only in classical application servers, but also more and more in the domain of Embedded Systems. The OSGi(tm) platform is one of these platforms dedicated to lightweight execution environments, and one of the most prominent. However, new platforms also imply new security flaws, and a lack of both knowledge and tools for protecting the exposed systems. This technical report aims at fostering the understanding of security mechanisms in component deployment. It focuses on securing the deployment of components. It presents the cryptographic mechanisms necessary for signing OSGi(tm) bundles, as well as the detailed process of bundle signature and validation. We also present the SFelix platform, which is a secure extension to Felix OSGi(tm) framework implementation. It includes our implementation of the bundle signature process, as specified by OSGi(tm) Release 4 Security Layer. Moreover, a tool for signing and publishing bundles, SFelix JarSigner, has been developed to conveniently integrate bundle signature in the bundle deployment process.",Cryptography and Security
11013,"Java Components Vulnerabilities - An Experimental Classification
  Targeted at the OSGi Platform","The OSGi Platform finds a growing interest in two different applications domains: embedded systems, and applications servers. However, the security properties of this platform are hardly studied, which is likely to hinder its use in production systems. This is all the more important that the dynamic aspect of OSGi-based applications, that can be extended at runtime, make them vulnerable to malicious code injection. We therefore perform a systematic audit of the OSGi platform so as to build a vulnerability catalog that intends to reference OSGi Vulnerabilities originating in the Core Specification, and in behaviors related to the use of the Java language. Standard Services are not considered. To support this audit, a Semi-formal Vulnerability Pattern is defined, that enables to uniquely characterize fundamental properties for each vulnerability, to include verbose description in the pattern, to reference known security protections, and to track the implementation status of the proof-of-concept OSGi Bundles that exploit the vulnerability. Based on the analysis of the catalog, a robust OSGi Platform is built, and recommendations are made to enhance the OSGi Specifications.",Cryptography and Security
11022,Remembrance: The Unbearable Sentience of Being Digital,"We introduce a world vision in which data is endowed with memory. In this data-centric systems paradigm, data items can be enabled to retain all or some of their previous values. We call this ability ""remembrance"" and posit that it empowers significant leaps in the security, availability, and general operational dimensions of systems. With the explosion in cheap, fast memories and storage, large-scale remembrance will soon become practical. Here, we introduce and explore the advantages of such a paradigm and the challenges in making it a reality.",Databases
11030,"A Data Capsule Framework For Web Services: Providing Flexible Data
  Access Control To Users","This paper introduces the notion of a secure data capsule, which refers to an encapsulation of sensitive user information (such as a credit card number) along with code that implements an interface suitable for the use of such information (such as charging for purchases) by a service (such as an online merchant). In our capsule framework, users provide their data in the form of such capsules to web services rather than raw data. Capsules can be deployed in a variety of ways, either on a trusted third party or the user's own computer or at the service itself, through the use of a variety of hardware or software modules, such as a virtual machine monitor or trusted platform module: the only requirement is that the deployment mechanism must ensure that the user's data is only accessed via the interface sanctioned by the user. The framework further allows an user to specify policies regarding which services or machines may host her capsule, what parties are allowed to access the interface, and with what parameters. The combination of interface restrictions and policy control lets us bound the impact of an attacker who compromises the service to gain access to the user's capsule or a malicious insider at the service itself.",Cryptography and Security
11046,How to Bypass Verified Boot Security in Chromium OS,"Verified boot is an interesting feature of Chromium OS that supposedly can detect any modification in the root file system (rootfs) by a dedicated adversary. However, by exploiting a design flaw in verified boot, we show that an adversary can replace the original rootfs by a malicious rootfs containing exploits such as a spyware or keylogger and still pass the verified boot process. The exploit is based on the fact that a dedicated adversary can replace the rootfs and the corresponding verification information in the bootloader. We experimentally demonstrate an attack using both the base and developer version of Chromium OS in which the adversary installs a spyware in the target system to send cached user data to the attacker machine in plain text which are otherwise encrypted, and thus inaccessible. We also demonstrate techniques to mitigate this vulnerability.",Cryptography and Security
11050,Security Issues in the Android Cross-Layer Architecture,"The security of Android has been recently challenged by the discovery of a number of vulnerabilities involving different layers of the Android stack. We argue that such vulnerabilities are largely related to the interplay among layers composing the Android stack. Thus, we also argue that such interplay has been underestimated from a security point-of-view and a systematic analysis of the Android interplay has not been carried out yet. To this aim, in this paper we provide a simple model of the Android cross-layer interactions based on the concept of flow, as a basis for analyzing the Android interplay. In particular, our model allows us to reason about the security implications associated with the cross-layer interactions in Android, including a recently discovered vulnerability that allows a malicious application to make Android devices totally unresponsive. We used the proposed model to carry out an empirical assessment of some flows within the Android cross-layered architecture. Our experiments indicate that little control is exercised by the Android Security Framework (ASF) over cross-layer interactions in Android. In particular, we observed that the ASF lacks in discriminating the originator of a flow and sensitive security issues arise between the Android stack and the Linux kernel, thereby indicating that the attack surface of the Android platform is wider than expected.",Cryptography and Security
